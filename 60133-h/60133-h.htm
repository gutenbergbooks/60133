<br /><i>Beyond the Earth</i></h2>
<p>The rocket ship <i>Shooting Star</i> powered
through the black deeps of space like a silver
bullet. Inside a room of their parents&rsquo; suite
aboard the vessel, Ted Kenton and his sister Jill
sat before a large window looking out at the wonders
of space in the year <span class="small">A.D.</span> 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if we&rsquo;re moving at all, does
it, Sis?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>Jill shook her auburn head. &ldquo;No, but it scares
me to know how fast we&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Ted straightened his sturdy young shoulders
and shook strands of brown hair out of his eyes.
It was natural that girls should be scared of things
connected with space travel, he thought. &ldquo;Thousands
of miles an hour isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; he said
lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if we should hit something!&rdquo; Jill
complained. &ldquo;It would be an awful crash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only things we have to worry about hitting
are meteors,&rdquo; Ted told her. &ldquo;The <i>Shooting
Star</i> has radar instruments that tell us when
they&rsquo;re headed straight at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father says that sometimes meteors come so
fast that space ships can&rsquo;t get out of the way of
them,&rdquo; Jill returned, with solemn eyes.</p>
<p>In brotherly fashion Ted pressed the shoulder
of his eleven-and-a-half-year-old sister, younger
than he by a year. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start worrying about
everything that can happen to us, Jill. We&rsquo;ve got
a lot ahead of us on Mars,&rdquo; he advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so sure I want to go to Mars,&rdquo; Jill
blurted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cold and bare and lonely there,
Ted. Why did Father have to sign up with the
Martian Archeology Society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted looked at her with some surprise. &ldquo;Dad
talked this over with us. You said you wanted to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem so scary then, although I didn&rsquo;t
really <i>want</i> to go, but out here in the dark where
there&rsquo;s never a sunrise and everything is so still
and quiet, I&mdash;I feel afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Dad or Mom know you feel this way?&rdquo;
Ted asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s counted so
much on us going to Mars. He was so lonely
there before without us. If he knew I didn&rsquo;t want
to go, he&rsquo;d feel he had to get a job on Earth. But
you know his first love is excavation on Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right, Sis, when we get settled in
our new home. They&rsquo;ve got it all ready for us.
Think of the fun it&rsquo;ll be!&rdquo; Ted said encouragingly.</p>
<p>Jill seemed to feel better and smiled. Both
turned their attention to the wondrous misty
veil of the Milky Way outside. It reminded Ted
of a great caravan of countless tiny sheep trooping
through the endless black of space night.
Each one of those millions of light points he
knew to be individual giant suns. How frighteningly
huge and marvelous was God&rsquo;s universe!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/i04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="800" />
<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;The Earth!&rdquo; She spoke in awe.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Directly in front of them hung the wrinkled
gray face of Luna, the Moon, which they would
pass before long. Ted shuddered at its forbidding
deep pits and miles of barren, dead plains.</p>
<p>Jill leaned forward eagerly on the window seat
on which they were perched, her nose almost
touching the clear plastic window. &ldquo;Ted!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that green ball below us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted looked, then grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even
know your own planet when you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Earth!&rdquo; She spoke in awe. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was not surprised that his sister had not
recognized the globe, in so far as neither of them
had seen it before from this dramatic position.
Ever since their fire-off from the Arizona space
harbor, the Earth had been out of their view, beneath
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jill cried. &ldquo;I can make out the outline
of Africa! It looks like it&rsquo;s buried under fog. I
didn&rsquo;t know before that you could actually <i>see</i>
the atmosphere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; Ted said, with mock superiority.
&ldquo;I bet you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s hundreds of miles
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who knows the answers,
Ted Kenton, even if you are pretty smart,&rdquo;
she returned. &ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;s the lack of atmosphere
out here in space that makes everything so
crystal clear. That&rsquo;s why we can see so many
thousands more stars out here than we can from
Earth under a layer of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad for a girl,&rdquo; Ted replied, with
a tolerant grin.</p>
<p>She shoved him in playful displeasure. Although
the push was not hard, it upset Ted&rsquo;s
balance, and he slipped off the window seat and
rolled onto the metal floor. Jill gasped in alarm
and darted to his side. As she tried to help him
up, she too lost her equilibrium and fell beside
him. Ted looked at her and laughed.</p>
<p>Their awkwardness was caused by the fact that
they wore magnetized shoes that were attracted
to the metal floor of the space ship. Even when
sitting down, they had kept the soles of their
shoes on the metal of the seat. Ted got to his feet
and helped Jill up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we ever get used to these funny shoes?&rdquo;
Jill complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t wear
them we&rsquo;d go floating around in the air like a
feather. That&rsquo;s another disadvantage of leaving
Earth. We don&rsquo;t have any weight at all in space.
If we wanted to, we could take off our shoes and
stretch out in the air just like on a soft couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be fun to swim around in here just
like a fish,&rdquo; Jill mused. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted knew he should stop her, but his curiosity
to see such an experiment prevented him from
giving in to the tug of his conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; Ted warned. &ldquo;Any motion you
make will be hard to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When her shoes were off, Jill pressed gently
upward from her toes. She shrieked in pleasure
as she rose gracefully into the air. Reaching the
ceiling of the room, she pushed against it and
floated downward again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lots of fun!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
try it, Ted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-uh. Another time. One of us had better
keep his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Jill tried other movements, whirling and doing
flip-overs. Then she grew bolder, moving
more swiftly. She teased Ted into trying to catch
her, and he finally got into the game. He lunged
at her but missed her fleet form every time. The
game grew more active. Presently both of them
were scampering about in the space-ship compartment,
laughing and having great fun.</p>
<p>Jill paused in one corner beneath an air-vent
box. &ldquo;Try and catch me!&rdquo; she taunted, her eyes
shiny with merriment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you get real
close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted glided catlike across the floor, his metal-soled
shoes clicking at every step. Only when he
was nearly upon her did she move. She flexed her
knees and soared off above him, laughing. His
hands raked the air but missed her agile form.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ted&rsquo;s heart seemed to stop dead.
&ldquo;Jill! Look out! You&rsquo;ll hit that air vent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw the danger too late. She screamed and
crashed heavily into the metal vent, head on. Her
head lolled in unconsciousness, and her body
hung limp as a broken toy against the ceiling of
the space-ship room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c2">CHAPTER TWO
<br /><i>Hurtling Danger</i></h2>
<p>His heart pounding in anxiety at Jill&rsquo;s
plight, Ted opened a door and dashed
into the next room of the suite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jill!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton looked up, startled, from the desk
where he had been studying. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Son!&rdquo; the
scientist said, jumping to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mom?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s down in the magazine shop,&rdquo; his father
answered, and added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably for the better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>They hurried into the observation room where
Ted and Jill had been so happy together only a
short time before. The boy pointed overhead at
the air vent, where Jill&rsquo;s limp form hung, lighter
than a thistle in her weightlessness.</p>
<p>Even Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s tall, stalwart form could
not reach high enough to bring her down.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have something to stand on,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Ted thought of the long window seat. He
rushed over and knelt down to examine it. &ldquo;The
window seat is in sections, Dad, and has some
clamps holding it down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We ought to
be able to get it loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s strong fingers released the
catches that held the seat in place. Then he lifted
it out and carried it across to the spot beneath the
air vent. He stood on the seat and grasped Jill&rsquo;s
slim body, bringing it down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The girl was stretched out waist high in the
air, in which position her father could best see
her injury. Ted held her so that a sudden movement
would not send her floating off. The scientist
found a cut on Jill&rsquo;s temple where she had
struck the air vent. She began stirring. In a few
seconds she had recovered consciousness. She was
pale and smiled feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to me?&rdquo; she asked in a weak
voice.</p>
<p>Only then did Dr. Kenton seem concerned
about the cause of the accident. He looked inquiringly
at Ted. &ldquo;Well, Ted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wanted to go without her shoes to see
what it felt like,&rdquo; Ted replied. &ldquo;I should have
stopped her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both should be tanned for a trick like
that,&rdquo; his father said gravely. &ldquo;Jill could have
been seriously injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They helped Jill to the window seat, then put
on her magnetic shoes for her. She said she felt
all right, but her father insisted that she have the
cut treated. A brief visit to the first-aid cabinet,
built into the wall of the room, had Jill&rsquo;s hurt
taken care of in a few moments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;What prompted you two to try such a stunt
as this?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton asked as he closed the door
of the first-aid cabinet. &ldquo;I thought you had been
well grounded on the facts of weightless bodies
in space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted, embarrassed, kicked the seat section they
had removed, forgetting that it was not fastened
down. It scooted off in the air, but Dr. Kenton
alertly grabbed it before it got far. &ldquo;I guess we
were just fidgety for something to do,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the scenery <i>is</i> getting a little monotonous
for you,&rdquo; their father replied. &ldquo;Maybe
I can arrange for you to stretch your legs a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we can tour the ship now?&rdquo; Jill
asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said, &ldquo;I believe the
confusion that always follows the fire-off is pretty
well under control now. I&rsquo;ll ask Commander
Grissom about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their father left and was back in a short while.
&ldquo;We can go,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave a note
for Mom to let her know where we&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scribbled it off, after getting a slip of paper
from a drawer in the wall desk. Then he asked
them, &ldquo;What would you like to see first?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>

<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Hi, folks,&rdquo; he greeted.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pilots&rsquo; roost!&rdquo; Ted said, and Jill nodded
in agreement. The three of them clicked along
the corridor in their magnetic shoes. Reaching
the pilots&rsquo; roost in the nose of the space ship, Dr.
Kenton knocked on the door and was told to enter.
Inside, the children found two men in the
light green with gold trim of the Space Transport
Command, sitting in big roomy seats in front of
a large bank of dials and levers. Above the panel
was a broad port looking out into space.</p>
<p>One of the pilots appeared to be busy. The unoccupied
one spun on his swivel seat and smiled
at the Kentons. &ldquo;Hi, folks,&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;Come
on in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He introduced himself as Lieutenant Foran
and his copilot as Lieutenant Starky, who took a
moment from his work to smile a greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On every trip we make we usually let the
passengers come in a few at a time,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Foran said, &ldquo;to look around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The pilot showed them what each dial on the
panel meant. Jill was soon bewildered by it all,
but Ted was interested in every gadget and meter.
He decided at that moment that he would
like nothing better than one day to be a pilot on
an interplanetary space liner.</p>
<p>Ted had noticed a huge circular screen built
into the middle of the panel, with circles radiating
out from the center of it. Suddenly it lighted
up, and white spots, or &ldquo;blips,&rdquo; began popping
out on the glass&rsquo;s phosphor coating. Ted saw that
the pilots&rsquo; eyes had flashed swiftly toward the
screen.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Starky leaned forward and twisted
a dial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the radarscope,&rdquo; Lieutenant Foran
said. &ldquo;The screen automatically lights up when
anything comes directly into our path, even if it&rsquo;s
many thousands of miles away. Those blips are
echoes we&rsquo;re receiving from our approaching
neighbors out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Foran went over to the panel, looking
up at the screen. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked his
companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be a ship,&rdquo; replied Lieutenant
Starky. &ldquo;Probably the mail rocket <i>Moonstone</i> on
its way back from Luna. The navigator said we&rsquo;d
pass it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Foran slid into his seat and pressed
a button on the panel. A voice from a speaker
said, &ldquo;Navigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Kentons heard the two crewmen
speak in low tones for several moments. Then
Lieutenant Foran switched off and turned to the
copilot with an apprehensive look on his face.
&ldquo;He says the <i>Moonstone</i> should have turned off
course before now! It&rsquo;s heading straight toward
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call the Commander!&rdquo; Lieutenant
Starky said, jabbing a button.</p>
<p>Jill squeezed her father&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Are we going
to crash?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, honey,&rdquo; her father said
soothingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ted saw the fear in his dad&rsquo;s eyes, and his
own heart seemed to squirm with terror in his
body. Was their very first journey into space
going to end tragically scarcely before it had
started?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c3">CHAPTER THREE
<br /><i>First Stop&mdash;Luna</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why they don&rsquo;t turn
off course!&rdquo; Lieutenant Starky exclaimed.
&ldquo;Their radar <i>must</i> have contacted us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted watched the blips from the <i>Moonstone</i>
slowly nearing the center of the screen. By the
time they did reach that center, the <i>Moonstone</i>
and the <i>Shooting Star</i> would be occupying the
same area in space.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Foran came over to the Kentons.
&ldquo;I think you folks had better get back to your
suite. We&rsquo;re going to be awfully busy in here for
the next few minutes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Ted could see that the officer was trying to
keep the fear out of his voice. They must really
be in a bad spot.</p>
<p>As they left, they met stout, red-faced Commander
Grissom coming in. His face was redder
than usual, and he was so concerned with the
<i>Shooting Star&rsquo;s</i> danger that he barely nodded to
Dr. Kenton.</p>
<p>As the Kentons returned to their quarters,
golden-haired Mrs. Kenton faced her family with
stricken eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening, John?&rdquo; she asked her
husband. &ldquo;All the crewmen are running around
like mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little trouble outside,&rdquo; the scientist
said gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Commander Grissom and
his men can handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton began pacing restlessly. &ldquo;This
waiting! I wish we knew what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; the scientist said, crossing the
room and pressing a button on a wall panel. &ldquo;I
thought it might upset us more to listen in, but
I guess it would be better to know what they&rsquo;re
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>They heard first the voice of Lieutenant Starky
coming over the compartment&rsquo;s loud-speaker.
&ldquo;<i>The Moonstone</i> has just answered, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; the commander asked
urgently.</p>
<p>After a few moments&rsquo; pause, the Kentons
heard the pilot speak again: &ldquo;They say that they
had some electronic trouble and that it&rsquo;s just now
been repaired. Their radio and radar were off
because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted listened tensely as orders flew back and
forth. Both space ships set their rocket jets to
carry each away from the other, but at the speeds
they were traveling, only time would tell if they
could avoid a crash.</p>
<p>The Kentons heard the final miles being
slowly called off by Commander Grissom as the
two ships hurtled toward one another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four hundred&mdash;three hundred&mdash;two&mdash;a hundred
and fifty....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s eyes were on the side port. He knew that
at the last moment either he would see a large
silver shape hurtle past the window or he would
feel the might of tons crashing head on. In the
final seconds, Dr. Kenton had an arm around his
wife and daughter, and Ted&rsquo;s heart was thumping
wildly.</p>
<p>The light of thousands of stars out there
seemed to burn into the boy&rsquo;s brain. Would the
decisive moment never come?</p>
<p>Presently Ted saw the blackness of space
blurred for only the briefest instant as the <i>Moonstone</i>
drove past, its rockets streaming tongues of
flame! The side jets spurted against the hull of
the <i>Shooting Star</i>, causing it to rock. Ted felt the
floor tilting beneath him, and he had to grab a
wall rail for support. A glimpse he caught of his
parents and Jill showed that they were having
the same trouble.</p>
<div class="img" id="i06">
<img src="images/i06.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="700" height="235" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>As the ship steadied itself and drove on an
even keel again, Ted grinned weakly. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
made it,&rdquo; he managed to say.</p>
<p>The faces of Jill and her mother were still
chalky with fright, but Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s was as calm
as if he had known the <i>Shooting Star</i> would come
through the peril all right.</p>
<p>They heard the voice of Commander Grissom
over the speaker informing the passengers that
the danger was past. Dr. Kenton then cut off the
speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to go through an experience
like that again!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Kenton, taking a seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need ever fear this happening
again,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a rare
occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about meteors?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rare too, fortunately,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t expect an uneventful
trip from now until we reach our home on
Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this confident remark, the children
were interested in the space ship again. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t finish our tour!&rdquo; Jill burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see the garden?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The garden?&rdquo; Ted asked, puzzled. &ldquo;What
good is a garden on a space ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said
and started for the door. Mrs. Kenton said she
preferred to stay in the suite and collect her shattered
nerves, but the children, of course, were
eager to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you two wondered how you&rsquo;re able
to breathe in the ship?&rdquo; their father asked as they
walked down the corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know how,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;The air is pumped
through the ship from compressed-air chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is air?&rdquo; his father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly oxygen and nitrogen,&rdquo; Ted answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Shooting Star</i> uses oxygen, with helium
instead of nitrogen to dilute it,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so that, in case a meteor penetrates the
ship, the rapid decompression won&rsquo;t cause us to
get bubbles in our blood, which is a dangerous
condition called &lsquo;the Bends.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s that to do with a garden?&rdquo; Jill
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see in a minute,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>An attendant showed them through the &ldquo;garden.&rdquo;
There was not much to see. There were
merely rows and rows of broad-leaved plants
covered with plastic and a network of tubes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some garden,&rdquo; Ted murmured, when the
attendant had walked off to answer a call. &ldquo;The
plants aren&rsquo;t pretty and they don&rsquo;t seem to have
fruit or vegetables either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They yield something even more precious,
though,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Oxygen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Ted asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Dr. Kenton smiled at the puzzled looks on
their faces. &ldquo;Plants and people are well suited to
one another,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Plants breathe out oxygen
into our Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and in gratitude
we give them back carbon dioxide which,
as you know, we breathe out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really quite simple,&rdquo; the scientist went
on. &ldquo;These plants keep our oxygen tanks filled,
and the air exhaled by us is pumped back to them
so that they can keep alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will our home on Mars have a garden producing
air?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll use air cartridges there because
they&rsquo;re more efficient in small places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the attendant returned. &ldquo;The commander
has ordered all passengers back to their
suites to prepare for emergency landing,&rdquo; he
told them. &ldquo;Jet fire from the <i>Moonstone</i> damaged
our hull, and we&rsquo;ve got to lay over on Luna
for repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody!&rdquo; Jill exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to land
on the Moon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>They returned to the main compartment of
their suite, and Dr. Kenton switched on the wall
speaker so that he could hear the order from the
commander to &ldquo;strap down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they waited, they stood before the big window
looking out on the rugged globe of Luna.
Dr. Kenton pressed a button on the sill that slid
a darkening filter over the window. In this way,
the blinding glare of the full moon was cut down
considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those big craters look just like eyes!&rdquo; Ted
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so terribly rough-looking down there,
I don&rsquo;t see where we can land!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton
said.</p>
<p>The scientist pointed. &ldquo;See that large gray
plain down there?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Sea of Serenity,
and the Moon colony is located on one edge
of it. We&rsquo;re too far away yet to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, we&rsquo;re turning around!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed,
as he saw the stars beginning to blur before his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so that we can use our rear jets to
brake our landing,&rdquo; the scientist said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The order to pull down couches and &ldquo;strap
down&rdquo; came over the speaker a few minutes
later. Each of the Kentons opened a door in the
wall and pulled down his foam-rubber cot. The
couches were fastened securely to the floor with
catches. The family stretched out on the soft mattresses.
They pulled up the plastic straps from
the sides and tightened them across their bodies.</p>
<p>Presently a crewman stuck his head in the door
to make sure they were ready for the strain of
landing.</p>
<p>Some time later, when he had the sensation of
going down in a suddenly dropping elevator,
Ted knew the moment of deceleration had begun.</p>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye he could picture what was
going on. He imagined the long sleekness of the
<i>Shooting Star</i> plunging toward the moon&rsquo;s rough
surface. From the ship&rsquo;s rocket tubes, streams of
fire were pouring out to slow the terrific speed of
the ship. If those fire streams should fail, or not
hold back the craft enough, the rocket would be
dashed to bits on Luna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>As the ship slackened its speed, Ted felt steadily
worse. It was as if his chest were being
crushed. He knew that he and the others could
stand any top speed the rocket would go; that it
was only a change in speed that was so grueling.</p>
<p>He twisted his head and saw the other members
of his family buried deeply in their couches.
He knew they were suffering as badly as he. He
remembered the danger of the <i>Shooting Star</i> and
<i>Moonstone</i> approaching one another in the heavens.
Then he thought what a frightful crash it
would have been had they met.</p>
<p>It made him wonder, now, if the <i>Shooting Star</i>
could check its downward plunge in time, or if it
would be dashed to atoms on the hard gray soil of
Luna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c4">CHAPTER FOUR
<br /><i>The Curious Boy</i></h2>
<p>Just as Ted was expecting the worst, he felt a
gentle bump beneath him. He looked around
and saw that the rest of his family were no longer
deep in their couches. That meant the heavy
pressure of their descent was off them. They must
have already landed!</p>
<p>But he could not get up yet, for he was in a
vertical position and hanging by his straps. This
was because the rocket had landed upright on its
tail fins.</p>
<p>Ted heard a rumbling sound. He felt the side
of the room to which the couches were fastened
slide down into normal position. Ted unbuckled
his straps and rose to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s time to get up!&rdquo; he said to the
others.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton unstrapped himself and then assisted
Mrs. Kenton. Ted helped get Jill loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! That was awful!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I left my stomach up in the sky!&rdquo;
Jill said.</p>
<p>Ted started toward the side window. &ldquo;I feel so
heavy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can hardly lift my feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father plodded with him to the window.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the gravity of Luna is added to
the ship&rsquo;s artificial gravity. They&rsquo;ll cut off the
rocket gravity any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out the window, Ted thought that
this was like a scene from a fairy tale. Any moment
he expected to see a group of gnomes come
frolicking past! But nothing appeared to be alive
in that craggy, lonely wilderness, except within
the man-made structure of lunar rock.</p>
<p>Jill and her mother, having taken longer to get
their bearings, finally joined the other two at the
window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes it so awfully bright out there?&rdquo;
asked Jill, squinting her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that we have a blanket of atmosphere
to protect us from the sun on earth, but
here on Luna the sun strikes with full force,&rdquo; her
father explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about a sunburn!&rdquo; Ted said, with a
whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t stand it long,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said,
chuckling grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot enough to boil water
out there right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when the sun is down, it must be nice,&rdquo;
put in Mrs. Kenton innocently.</p>
<p>Her husband grinned. &ldquo;If you call over two
hundred degrees below zero centigrade nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crisp voice came over the speaker: &ldquo;All passengers
to the dressing room to don space gear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we have to go out in that?&rdquo; Mrs.
Kenton asked, shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any other way of getting to the
settlement across the way,&rdquo; was Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s gentle
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>As the Kentons were walking along the corridor
to the dressing room, they suddenly felt light
on their feet. The unexpectedness of it sent them
colliding with one another. A voice from a wall
speaker said: &ldquo;Watch your step. The artificial
gravity of the ship has been cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a feather!&rdquo; Jill said, dancing along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should&mdash;you weigh only one sixth of
your Earth weight,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;But you be
careful or you&rsquo;ll have another accident like you
did earlier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers lined up to receive their space
gear. It was bulky equipment, but not very heavy
in the light gravity. In the dressing room, several
crewmen demonstrated how to put on the space
suits.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton, who had put on much space gear
in his time, helped his family into theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb into the flexible suit first,&rdquo; he said, as
he demonstrated. &ldquo;Then all you have to do is to
zip it up&mdash;so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these tubes on our backs?&rdquo; Jill
asked, after the asbestos-covered suits were
donned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your oxygen source,&rdquo; her father said.
&ldquo;Those smaller boxes are refrigerator units that
cool the air so that you won&rsquo;t burn up in the
terrible heat out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weighted shoes were pulled on next. These
were heavy, in order to bring the wearer more
nearly to his Earth weight. Dr. Kenton helped
them on next with their plastic fish-bowl helmets,
fastening them in place with catches.</p>
<p>They found that they could talk to one another,
even from the air-tight helmets, because of
a compact radio attachment on the top. Last to be
put on were protective gloves.</p>
<p>When everyone in the dressing room was fully
attired, the strange company left the ship
through an air lock&mdash;a pair of doors which kept
the air pressure from escaping. The <i>Shooting
Star&rsquo;s</i> gangplank, which was actually a long escalator,
slid out of the side of the ship on gears
until the bottom touched ground. Then the passengers
stepped out of the air lock onto it and
were carried slowly downward. The rocket, in
landing on her tail fins, was now in position for
the fire-off later into space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange feeling it is,&rdquo; thought Ted,
setting foot on a world outside of his own beloved
Earth! The ground they walked on was soft and
powdery, and his father said it was called pumice.</p>
<p>The party was heading for a ring of stone
buildings ahead, which were connected to one
another by long tunnels. It reminded Ted of a
giant wheel turned over on the ground. At the
center was the largest building of all. Ted asked
his father what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the headquarters building,&rdquo; the
scientist answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called the Hub, and it
acts as a central control for all the other buildings
around the circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the buildings connected with one
another?&rdquo; Jill wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so the people inside can go from one to
the other without having to put on space suits.
You see, all the buildings and connecting corridors
are filled with compressed air. The Moon
has no air of its own, so it has to be manufactured
just as it is on the <i>Shooting Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted thought his father&rsquo;s voice sounded queer
coming over his helmet receiver, but he guessed
he would get used to it in time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/i07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="742" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s the headquarters building.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The party from the <i>Shooting Star</i> entered a
building where they removed their space suits.
They were told that they were free to do whatever
they liked until the ship was repaired for the
journey to Mars.</p>
<p>Some of the passengers said that they would
like to make a tour of the Wheel, and when
others also expressed a wish to do so, a guide took
the entire party around. The Kenton children
found that most of the departments had to do
with scientific research, while the rest were devoted
to the running of the colony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they haul all these stones from Earth to
build this place?&rdquo; Ted asked, as they went down
one of the long rock passageways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness no!&rdquo; his father replied with a
laugh. &ldquo;The whole colony is built of lunar rock,
quarried near by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Wheel had been circled by the sightseers
and it was learned that the <i>Shooting Star</i>
would not be ready for hours for the fire-off, Dr.
Kenton made a suggestion to his family as they
sat idly with the other passengers in the lounge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have an astronomer friend who runs an observatory
not far from here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would
you kids like to visit it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, and they
both nodded as one. Mrs. Kenton, however, was
not so ambitious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;That long walk around
this building will last me for a good while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted noticed a sandy-haired boy of his own age
watching them closely. Even as they made the
tour around the Wheel, the boy had listened
intently to everything Dr. Kenton had said. And
when the scientist had mentioned going to Mars,
Ted saw that his eyes had lighted up as though
with longing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to take the other passengers
with us,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton told his son and daughter,
&ldquo;because there aren&rsquo;t enough cars available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Dr. Kenton had chartered a car from the
motor pool, he and his son and daughter went to
the dressing room to climb into their space gear.
As they were zipping up their suits, Ted looked
toward the open doorway and saw the same curious
boy watching them again! What could be his
interest in them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c5">CHAPTER FIVE
<br /><i>Pelting Stones</i></h2>
<p>Ted decided he would find out just why the
boy was watching them. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Ted
greeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; the boy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Randy Matthews,&rdquo; the boy returned.</p>
<p>Before Ted could go on with his questioning,
Dr. Kenton spoke up. &ldquo;Randy, would you like to
go with us to visit the observatory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I would,&rdquo; was the ready reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better check with your folks first,&rdquo; Dr.
Kenton advised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any folks here,&rdquo; Randy said.
&ldquo;Mr. Collins is taking care of me. He&rsquo;s an engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then check with him and come on back if
you can,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said.</p>
<p>When Randy had left, Ted said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
watching us a long time, Dad, just as if he
couldn&rsquo;t wait to make friends with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it, too,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;I wonder
what he meant when he said he has no folks
<i>here</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy got back shortly and said he could go
with them. The Kentons had to wait for him to
dress, but they were surprised at his speed. He
seemed to know all the fasteners and fittings perfectly.</p>
<p>The four of them left the building and went
outside where an odd vehicle awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a funny-looking car!&rdquo; Jill exclaimed,
and Ted could hear her merry laugh ring in his
helmet receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fresh-air taxi!&rdquo; Ted put in.</p>
<p>The car had enormous tires and an open top.
It looked more like a tractor than anything else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s climb in,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. He helped
the children in, then took the driver&rsquo;s seat. He
turned a switch, and they were off.</p>
<p>When they had gotten up speed, Ted thought
this the most exciting ride he had ever taken!
They bounced along over the rough ground
without feeling any of the bumps. Dr. Kenton
explained that the tires were low-pressured and
shock-absorbent.</p>
<p>The young folks were so impressed by their
ride that it was much later before they took time
to notice the breath-taking beauty of the sky. The
stars were so numerous, they looked like swaths
of white dust against the absolute blackness.
Randy was the first to notice the big green globe
of Earth behind them, and pointed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me homesick seeing it,&rdquo; Jill said,
and Ted detected a tremor in her voice.</p>
<p>Ted couldn&rsquo;t help admiring Jill for her courage
in agreeing to come along against her wishes,
just to keep the family together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>When the Moon car reached the observatory,
Ted did not find exactly what he had expected.
Instead of a white tower, like the observatories at
home, what he saw was a natural, tall column of
jagged rock, on the top of which was a man-made
shiny dome with a slit in it where the telescope
eye peeped out.</p>
<p>The four got out of the car and walked
through a doorway that had been blasted
through the rock in some time past. Beyond this
was an air lock that kept the compressed air of the
observatory from escaping.</p>
<p>When they had gone through the door, the
four found facing them a crude elevator. Dr.
Kenton motioned the young people inside and
then followed. He threw a switch, and the elevator
cage began rising slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This column of rock has always been hollow,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;so it was easy to run an
elevator up through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unfastened his helmet and took it off. &ldquo;You
can take off your hats now,&rdquo; he told the children.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s air in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The elevator stopped at the top of the shaft.
The four got out and entered a big room with a
rounded ceiling. Ted knew this to be the dome
that housed the telescope. The reflector was like
a huge cylinder resting in its horseshoe yoke
across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Dr. Kenton called. &ldquo;Is anyone
home?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i08">
<img src="images/i08.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="318" />
</div>
<p>Suddenly a round face appeared at the side of
the telescope. The face reminded Ted of a circus
clown&rsquo;s, with its wild, wispy hair and broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Kenton!&rdquo; cried the little man, as he ran
out and embraced Ted&rsquo;s dad. The elderly scientist
asked, &ldquo;What in the world are you doing on
Luna? And who are these young folks with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Dr. Kenton explained that he was on a stop-over
to Mars, and he introduced the children to
the funny little scientist, whose name was Dr.
Beeler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had some time to kill so we decided
to visit the observatory,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton finished.
&ldquo;Will you show the children some of the sights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Beeler&rsquo;s eyes brightened with pleasure.
Ted was sure that the little man was truly enjoying
their visit. Ted thought he must get awfully
lonesome up here by himself.</p>
<p>Dr. Beeler set the position of the telescope by
turning two cranks. Then he conducted the children
up a catwalk to a platform about twelve feet
from the floor. Jill took the first peek through the
eyepiece at the top of the tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooh&mdash;it&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; Jill cried with a gasp.</p>
<p>Ted let Randy have the next turn, and then he
himself looked. The view was breath-taking.
What he saw was the flattened, white globe of
Saturn with its graceful rings and many satellites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Moon is much better than the Earth for
using a telescope,&rdquo; Dr. Beeler said, &ldquo;because here
there is no atmosphere or haze to get in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The children saw other captivating sights.
There was the shimmering pearl of Venus,
Earth&rsquo;s twin, then Jupiter, the king of planets,
with its four orderly larger moons. The children
also saw smoky-looking nebulae and star clusters
that resembled bees in a hive. Then Dr. Beeler
showed them what he seemed to think was the
greatest treat of all&mdash;the Earth under high magnification.
When Jill placed her eye to the eyepiece,
she suddenly turned away, sobbing.</p>
<p>Dr. Beeler and her father came running to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, honey?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;m homesick!&rdquo; Jill said. &ldquo;I miss the
green grass and the blue sky terribly! Oh, why
did we ever have to leave home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted saw his father&rsquo;s face grow grave. Now his
dad knew that Jill had never wanted to come
along. Her father placed his arm around her
shoulders. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you felt this way,&rdquo; he
said softly.</p>
<p>Dr. Beeler stood by, fidgeting as though he
wanted to say something but didn&rsquo;t know just
what.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Presently Dr. Kenton looked at his wrist watch
which he could read through the plastic cuff of
his space suit. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get back to the
colony,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The <i>Shooting Star</i> may be
nearly ready to take off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came down off the catwalk to the floor
level where they took their leave of Dr. Beeler.
Ted saw a sad look in the old astronomer&rsquo;s eyes
as though he would have liked them to stay
longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to all of you,&rdquo; Dr. Beeler said.
Then to Jill he added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, young lady.
You won&rsquo;t find Mars such a bad place. And you&rsquo;ll
be seeing the good old Earth again, some day,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the four went down in the elevator, Jill
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was such a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; her father returned. &ldquo;I must confess
I&rsquo;ve been a little homesick myself since leaving
Earth. How about you, Ted, and you,
Randy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted had to admit to a certain amount himself,
but the Kentons were surprised to hear Randy&rsquo;s
opinion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; Randy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not homesick for
Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted could not understand why a person
should prefer the other planets to their own
home world. Ted could see that his father felt
the same, for he gave their new young friend an
odd look.</p>
<p>Ted thought it would be a good time to learn
something more about the mysterious Randy,
and he was about to ask some questions when the
cage touched the ground floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody out,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;Put on
your helmets and turn on your air valves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time for questioning now. The
three younger folks did as instructed. Ted liked
the caressing feeling he got as the air pumped
up his suit. It was like a soft summer breeze
against his skin. It made him want to giggle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The explorers climbed into their car outside,
and Dr. Kenton started it. Then they went flying
across the bleak gray moonscape, back toward
the Wheel. Jill had gotten over her gloom, and
the excitement of the carefree ride prompted
her to start singing. It was a well-known song that
all the school children at home knew, and Ted
and her father both joined in. Dr. Kenton invited
Randy to chime in, but the boy surprised
them once more when he said that he did not
even know the song! This only added to the
mystery of Randy.</p>
<p>Suddenly the scientist jammed the brakes on
so suddenly that the children were pitched forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Ted asked, when he had regained
his wits.</p>
<p>He was surprised to see his father leap from his
seat and vault to the ground. &ldquo;Out of here&mdash;all of
you&mdash;quickly!&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>His insistent voice brought them tumbling
out of the car to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jill cried frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See those spurts of dust just up ahead?&rdquo; her
father said, pointing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re meteorites striking
the ground. We almost blundered right into
a meteor shower!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>He looked around. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find some
shelter,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;A cave&mdash;a clump of rocks&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bunch of rocks!&rdquo; Randy said, indicating
a clump off to their left.</p>
<div class="img" id="i09">
<img src="images/i09.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="398" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be the closest place!&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>They broke into a run across the ground, slipping
and sliding in the powdery pumice. Ted
saw bursts of Moon dust closer now, and they
were coming with greater frequency. One huge
geyser several feet away threw a shower of sand
over all of them, blinding them momentarily.</p>
<p>When the &ldquo;air&rdquo; cleared, Ted was shocked to
find Randy missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Randy?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is&mdash;on the ground,&rdquo; Jill shrieked,
pointing behind them.</p>
<p>Ted turned, and his heart seemed to stop beating
for a moment. Randy was stretched out flat.
He was unmoving, still as death!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c6">CHAPTER SIX
<br /><i>Into Space Again</i></h2>
<p>The Kentons dashed out into the open to the
spot where their young friend lay. They
bent over him. He was struggling feebly, and his
mouth was open and gasping as though he could
not get his breath. His suit was almost deflated.
The meteorites had stopped falling, and there
was no further danger from them.</p>
<p>Ted saw that his father seemed to know just
what to do. He swiftly zipped open a pocket
in the side of Randy&rsquo;s suit and took out a small
strip of sticky fabric. There was a tiny slit in the
boy&rsquo;s suit where a stone had grazed it. Dr. Kenton
stuck the strip over the tear and pressed it firmly.
Then he opened wider the air valve on Randy&rsquo;s
helmet, and the suit puffed out again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Presently Randy&rsquo;s eyes opened, and he pushed
himself up into a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asked, almost in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A meteorite grazed your suit, deflating it,&rdquo;
the scientist replied. &ldquo;For a few seconds you were
like a fish out of water. We&rsquo;ll have the doctor
check you over when we get back, but I think we
brought you around in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They helped him to his feet. At first, he was
wobbly, but he soon regained his full strength
and was able to walk alone by the time they
reached the car.</p>
<p>They climbed into the Moon vehicle and
went whirling off in another swift-paced ride
back toward the Wheel. When they arrived at the
Moon colony, Dr. Kenton had a physician examine
Randy to make sure he was all right,
which proved to be the case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Soon the broadcasting loud-speakers announced
that the <i>Shooting Star</i> had been repaired
and would fire off within the next hour.
In the waiting room the Kentons held what they
believed was their last meeting with their new
friend Randy.</p>
<p>There was still much about the boy which
puzzled Ted&mdash;there were loads of questions he
would have liked to ask him. Although he did
not talk much, Randy seemed to like to be
with the Kentons. And now that the parting was
nearly at hand, Ted thought he appeared very
downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sure miss you, Randy,&rdquo; Jill was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said kindly. &ldquo;Too
bad you can&rsquo;t go along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this last remark, Randy looked up wistfully.
Ted had an idea that Randy would like nothing
better than to go with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been to Mars, Randy?&rdquo; Ted
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied gently. &ldquo;I was born
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>All the Kentons straightened in surprise. No
wonder Randy had said he was not homesick for
Earth, Ted thought. He knew the boy did not
mean that he was a native Martian, but that his
father was an Earthman who had been on Mars
when Randy had been born.</p>
<p>Ted knew that his father had decided to evade
the mystery of Randy no longer when he asked
the direct question: &ldquo;Randy, do you mind telling
us where your parents are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy&rsquo;s eyes dropped, and his slender fingers
began twisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother is dead. My father is somewhere
on Mars with an engineering expedition. That&rsquo;s
why Mr. Collins is taking care of me. He&rsquo;s a close
friend of Father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, do you know which expedition your father
is with?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Number
Five Syrtis Major Expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was watching his father as he asked the
question. A cold, unexplainable feeling coursed
through him. When Randy replied, Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s
face suddenly paled, and he turned away. Ted
felt a stab of dread. Had something happened to
the No. 5 Expedition? What a terrible tragedy
for Randy if this were so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sure miss Pops,&rdquo; Randy said softly, a
dreamy look on his face. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for
two years. We had lots of fun together. He was
teaching me to play baseball&mdash;helping me develop
a curve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the most Randy had ever said at one
time, and the Kentons listened raptly. Ted could
see that his father was disturbed over Randy&rsquo;s
case. He took out his handkerchief and blew his
nose hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Randy, how would you like to go to Mars
with us?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton asked presently.</p>
<p>Ted saw the sunshine of joy flare up in the
boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;C&mdash;could I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the scientist said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be glad
to have you, wouldn&rsquo;t we, Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton smiled softly at the boy. &ldquo;We
certainly would, Randy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy needed no further urging. First he
checked with his guardian, Mr. Collins, who
came to see Dr. Kenton. Mr. Collins was a husky,
friendly person. Randy was off packing as the
men talked in the presence of the other Kentons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be the best thing in the
world for the boy,&rdquo; Mr. Collins said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;The Fifth Expedition was given up for
lost about a week ago. I&rsquo;ve kept it from Randy
all this time, hoping that the lost explorers would
turn up. But they never have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew about the expedition,&rdquo; Ted&rsquo;s father
said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want to take him. I thought
we&rsquo;d accept him into our family, so that when
the news came to him, he might not take it so
hard. I guess I&rsquo;ve got a soft spot in my heart for
the pioneers on Mars, being a scientist myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand thing you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Mr. Collins
said.</p>
<p>When Mr. Collins left, Mrs. Kenton said to
her husband, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to tell Randy about
his father ourselves, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In due time,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton replied, &ldquo;after he
comes to know us better. It&rsquo;ll be easier that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Randy will be able to tell us all about Mars,
since he&rsquo;s from there,&rdquo; Jill said excitedly.</p>
<p>Ted agreed with his sister and decided then
that Randy was going to make a very welcome
addition to the Kenton household.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, the <i>Shooting Star</i> was
in the heavens again, powering toward the distant
red beacon of Mars and leaving behind the
rugged wastelands of the Moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="787" />
<p class="caption"><i>He was going to Mars.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Randy became a much more chipper person
than the silent boy the Kentons had first met.
New life seemed to have flowed into him. He was
going to Mars, the land of his birth and the place
where he believed his beloved father to be&mdash;alive.
Ted felt sorry for the boy in the days that followed,
whenever he talked about the good times
he and his father had had together. When the
time came to tell him about his father, it was not
going to be an easy job for Ted&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>In the eternal night of interplanetary space,
time seemed to stand still. Ted knew that days
and days, even weeks, had passed since leaving
the Moon, but without the rising and setting of
a sun to go by, it hardly seemed that any time had
passed at all.</p>
<p>By now the Moon had lost its roundness and
had become just another star in the sky. The red
spark of Mars, however, was growing day after
day, week after week. However, it could not yet
be recognized as a disk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>One day Ted noticed what looked like a
smudge across the blackness of the sky. It blotted
out the stars behind it and appeared to be close.
But its movement was scarcely noticeable. Ted
called his father&rsquo;s attention to the blur of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a comet!&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
check with the commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist tuned in a two-way speaker system
and asked about Ted&rsquo;s find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Brooking&rsquo;s Comet, discovered back in
1970,&rdquo; Commander Grissom replied. &ldquo;It circles
the sun every eight years. You&rsquo;re in for a treat.
We&rsquo;ll pass through some of its vapor. It&rsquo;ll be a
spectacular sight a few days from now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching the comet took up nearly all of the
idle time of Ted, Jill, and Randy in the hours
that followed. Under Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s guidance they
drew a chart of that part of the sky in which it
was located, and plotted its motion in relation to
that of the space ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;ll crash into us, do you?&rdquo;
Mrs. Kenton asked worriedly, as the comet
loomed menacingly outside their compartment
window some time later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Dr. Kenton soothed her with a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the skipper says we&rsquo;ll graze it,
that&rsquo;s exactly what will happen. He knows every
inch of this comet&rsquo;s orbit and our own too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton explained that the comet appeared
to move slowly because it was coming practically
head on. Steadily it blossomed wider, like an
opening flower bud. In the center was a brilliant
light, which was the head, or nucleus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t the gravitation of the comet pull
us into it?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because a comet has very little mass,
or what we&rsquo;d call real body, to it. It&rsquo;s mostly a big
lump of widely scattered gas particles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big is it?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head is almost as big as Luna, and it has
a tail many thousands of miles long,&rdquo; her father
answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pass us at hundreds of miles a
second, but it will take a long time to get by and
will hardly seem to be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>When the day of the arrival of the comet&rsquo;s
nucleus came, every eye on the <i>Shooting Star</i> was
peering intently out the windows of the rocket
ship. The commander had ordered all windows
covered with filter screens to cut out the blinding
glare of the nucleus.</p>
<p>The comet arrived with the shocking brilliance
of a gigantic fireball. All Ted could see was
an over-all blinding whiteness that made the
blackness of space like bright noonday. The stars
were blotted out completely in the glare. For
hours the brilliance continued without letup,
and then it began to dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head is past,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;From
now on, the light will grow weaker and weaker
as the tail goes by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted still could make out no detail of any kind,
and this was disappointing. As he and Jill and
Randy kept their eyes glued to the window, all
they could see was a slow dimming of the comet&rsquo;s
original brilliance. They grew weary of the sight
and turned away from it. When they returned to
it many hours later, the heavens had a strange
bluish cast, and the stars began to burn through
it weakly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Still later, only the barest evidence of the celestial
body remained. The heavens were only
slightly grayed, showing that the tip of the tail
alone had not passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we see the comet after it swings around
the sun, and heads out into space again?&rdquo; Ted
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from a greater distance,&rdquo; his father answered.
&ldquo;Then it will look more like a comet to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several days later, Jill came running into their
compartment, looking concerned. &ldquo;Father, I saw
some of the passengers going forward into the
pilots&rsquo; roost. They stayed there a few minutes,
then came out, and some more people went in.
What do you suppose it&rsquo;s all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea the commander has a treat for
us,&rdquo; her father replied with a knowing grin.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get our turn. Just wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their chance came shortly later. The Kentons
and Randy were summoned forward, and they
entered the pilots&rsquo; roost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see something?&rdquo; the commander
asked. &ldquo;Look out the forward window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>They spoke first to the pilots they had met before,
then peered out the window. Ted&rsquo;s breath
came fast. Poised regally against the backdrop of
stars was a gleaming red-orange globe. It was the
planet Mars, their new home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c7">CHAPTER SEVEN
<br /><i>Invisible Menace</i></h2>
<p>The Kentons studied the red planet in silent
awe. Beneath the thin cotton of atmosphere,
they saw the crisscross markings of the canals that
had baffled Earthmen for many years. Two small
globes hovered in the deeps beyond. They were
the two moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>
<p>Randy unconsciously shoved forward ahead of
the Kentons. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder when we&rsquo;ll be landing,&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<p>The commander, who had heard her, answered,
&ldquo;In fifty hours, young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better get back to our suite so
that some of the other passengers can come in,&rdquo;
Dr. Kenton said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>They thanked the commander and left the
pilots&rsquo; roost. When they had returned to their
compartment, Ted asked Randy, &ldquo;Have you ever
been to Earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy shook his head. &ldquo;It sounds like a terrific
place, though. I&rsquo;ve studied a lot about it in our
Earth Geography course in school, and Pops has
told me a lot about it. Imagine playing baseball
outdoors without a space suit on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted realized he had always taken the wonders
of Earth for granted. It was hard to understand
that a boy such as Randy existed&mdash;a boy who had
never experienced such a free life. He tried to
imagine how it would be if he had lived all of
his life on a world where all the breaths you took
were from tanks of artificial air, and where you
could never feel the cooling breezes of summer
or the spicy winter winds in your lungs. Thinking
about these things made Ted thankful that
he was not in Randy&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Suddenly an urgent voice came over the
speaker in the Kentons&rsquo; suite: &ldquo;Attention, everyone.
Act quickly but do not be frightened. A
leak has developed in our antiradiation shield.
Everyone retire immediately to the rear store
compartment at the extreme end of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Kenton.
&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time for explanations later,&rdquo; replied
Dr. Kenton. &ldquo;The first thing is to do as he
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried out of the compartment and
down the corridor aft. There were crewmen stationed
along the aisle at intervals to calm the
people&rsquo;s fears and keep them orderly. A warning
bell signifying trouble was pealing throughout
the ship.</p>
<p>The Kentons and Randy crowded into the
farthest rear room of the <i>Shooting Star</i> with the
other passengers, all of whom were chattering
excitedly. When the last passenger was in, the
transparent door was fastened shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we have to come way back here, Father?&rdquo;
Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because rays are loose in the ship,&rdquo; her father
replied. &ldquo;The farther we are from the atomic
engines up front, the safer we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they dangerous?&rdquo; his wife asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;They could be, in sufficient intensity. Right
now, they&rsquo;re closing all the doors along the corridors.
The doors have built-in screens to resist the
rays, if they are not too strong. Keep your eyes on
the light bulb out in the corridor. If it turns red,
it means the rays have penetrated that far!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Kenton. &ldquo;I knew we
shouldn&rsquo;t have left Earth. Now it looks like we&rsquo;ll
never reach our new home, after getting so close,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s
crew knows how to handle this. They have electronic
instruments they turn on that attract the
rays like a magnet. They can clean out the entire
ship in about half an hour. That bulb in the corridor
will light if even the slightest bit of radiation
is present. There&rsquo;s another bulb in the corner
of this room, but let&rsquo;s certainly hope this one
doesn&rsquo;t light up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Ted heard a groan from one of the passengers.
The light in the corridor was beginning to glow.
That meant the radiation had penetrated all
the way to the rear of the ship. The next thing
to watch was the bulb inside the room, Ted
thought. His father had not said so, but Ted
guessed that they would probably be in serious
trouble if this last one should light.</p>
<p>Presently figures clothed in weird metallic
suits and carrying shiny instruments were seen
in the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crew is protected by those suits,&rdquo; Dr.
Kenton explained. &ldquo;The things they are carrying
are the magnetic ray catchers I was telling you
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jill said suddenly. &ldquo;The red light has
gone out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothing to worry about, then.&rdquo; The
scientist spoke with relief. &ldquo;I would say those
men got to us just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the curiously garbed men unfastened
the door of the storeroom and beckoned for the
passengers to come out. Then he opened the
front piece of his helmet to speak to them: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go through the next door until you hear the all-clear
whistle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be just a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/i11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="723" />
<p class="caption"><i>Figures in weird metallic suits.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>When the whistle blew, the corridor doors
were opened and the passengers returned to their
sections. After the Kentons were back in their
suite, Mrs. Kenton sighed deeply and slumped
in an air-cushioned chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still quivery.
If it&rsquo;s not one thing it&rsquo;s another on these space
voyages! I&rsquo;m surprised we&rsquo;re still alive after all
that&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you can&rsquo;t say the trip is boring,
Mother,&rdquo; Jill piped up, and this brought a relaxing
laugh from the others.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Nearly two days later Mars was a giant world
dead ahead. Ted looked out the window with
Jill and Randy and saw a close-up view of the
strange land that was to be their new home. A
great network of deep, straight gorges split the
boundless stretches of red desert. These were the
fabulous canals built by the ancient Martians,
now long dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Prime Canal,&rdquo; Randy said, pointing
to the largest chasm of all. &ldquo;It feeds all the
little canals in this section.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those trees growing along the canals?&rdquo;
Jill asked.</p>
<p>Randy nodded. &ldquo;Evergreens,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that white stuff in the bottom of the
canals and near the roots of the trees?&rdquo; Ted
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s frost,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;The sun
never melts it completely. It never even gets up
to zero in this latitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton, whose interest was beyond Mars
at the moment, said, &ldquo;Look, kids, there&rsquo;s our
comet again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed it out to them in the heavens. It
was a long streak across the sky. The nucleus
burned brightly, like a heavenly torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it really looks like a comet!&rdquo; Ted declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; Jill murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to see it from Mars for several
days,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton told them. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll gradually
disappear from view.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>At this point the <i>Shooting Star</i> began its turnabout
for rearward landing. Then, still later, the
order that all those aboard the <i>Shooting Star</i> had
been waiting a long time to hear came over the
loud-speakers. &ldquo;Strap down on couches, everyone!
Next stop&mdash;Lowell Harbor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of their journey was at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c8">CHAPTER EIGHT
<br /><i>The New World</i></h2>
<p>The Kentons had experienced their last landing
for a while. After a final gentle bump,
Ted shook his head to clear it and waited for the
side wall to move into proper position. Then he
began unfastening the straps of his couch. He
was the first to his feet. As the rest of his family
were unbuckling, he did what everyone always
did after a space-ship landing. He went over to
the window and looked out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Mars&mdash;their new home. At last they were here.
From his height of several hundred feet above
the ground, Ted had the best view he would ever
have of Lowell Harbor, center of Earthmen&rsquo;s activity
on the ruddy planet. It had been named in
honor of Percival Lowell, the great astronomer
of the past century who had been so strongly interested
in Martian geography.</p>
<p>Ted felt a breath on his cheek. He turned, and
there was Randy right behind him. There were
tears of joy in his eyes, and Ted knew that this
must be one of the happiest days of Randy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful spaceport!&rdquo; said Mrs. Kenton,
who had come over to the window with the
other members of the family.</p>
<p>A huge waterway cut the landscape in two at
the edge of the spaceport. Beyond this stood two
large square buildings of transparent plastic substance.
Still farther out was a sprinkling of
houses, one of which the Kentons would occupy.
As far as Ted could see, the ground was rust-red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes Mars so red?&rdquo; Jill asked her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s believed that Mars once contained much
more oxygen than it does now,&rdquo; the scientist replied,
&ldquo;and the ground was nearer the color we&rsquo;re
used to seeing it at home. But over the centuries
the oxygen was absorbed by the soil, forming
iron oxide, which is the redness we see now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any oxygen left?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; replied Dr. Kenton. &ldquo;That may
be what caused the Martian races to disappear.
This is the greatest mystery about Mars and is
one of the main reasons I&rsquo;m here&mdash;to discover
why there are no Martians here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;re birds and animals and insects,&rdquo;
Ted said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they suffocate too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton shrugged helplessly. &ldquo;Another
mystery. Maybe they were able to adapt themselves
to the change over the thousands of years
by growing larger breathing apparatuses or something
like that. Apparently, man was the one who
lost out in the battle of survival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command to disembark came over the
speaker, and the Kentons gathered up what small
luggage they had kept with them and retired to
the dressing room. When they had suited up with
the other passengers, they entered the air lock
and waited for the escalator to roll into position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>As soon as Randy&rsquo;s feet touched the soil moments
later, Ted saw him stoop down and seize
a handful of red dust and let it trickle slowly
through his gloved fingers.</p>
<div class="img" id="i12">
<img src="images/i12.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="351" />
</div>
<p>The commander addressed the group that was
gathered around him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to
have you people with us. This is where we part.
A steward will take you over the bridge across the
canal to one of the large buildings on the other
side where you will register. A truck will bring
your luggage over later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>As the party walked buoyantly over the ground
toward the bridge, Jill said, &ldquo;I sure feel light-footed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;You weigh
less than half of your Earth weight here. Wait
until you go back to Earth after this low-gravity
life. You&rsquo;ll be tired for about six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; Jill answered earnestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so glad to get back.&rdquo; Ted could see that
despite the excitement of their new surroundings,
Jill&rsquo;s thoughts were still on her distant
home in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, Ted looked over the side
at the calm waters of the canal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bridge is five hundred feet across and
took quite a bit of engineering work,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said, &ldquo;but it still wasn&rsquo;t as big a job as the
Martians did on this canal and the others all over
the planet. How they built these giant waterways
is another great mystery we may never know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Aren&rsquo;t those the little boats you were
telling us about?&rdquo; Jill asked, pointing.</p>
<p>There were a number of tributaries extending
out from the canal. It was along these that the
individual houses were located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a
boat of our own, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving Earth, Dr. Kenton had explained
to his family about the transportation
system that connected the people with the main
headquarters building of Lowell Harbor. When
the colony had first been built, it was figured that
the cost of fuel and cars for each individual family
could be saved by making use of the natural
waterways. A simple aluminum boat could run
on cheaper fuel.</p>
<p>The new arrivals entered the nearer of the
two largest buildings in the colony, and because
of the compressed air inside, dared remove their
helmets. In here were housed all facilities that
had to do with the running of the settlement.</p>
<p>As they walked down the corridor to the registration
room, Dr. Kenton said, &ldquo;You see, the
building is made entirely of panes of heavy plastic
so that a hundred per cent sunlight gets in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After registering, the Kentons were assigned
their new home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve got the house farthest out,
Dr. Kenton,&rdquo; the clerk said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last family
to arrive, and they&rsquo;re not building any more
until more materials are sent from Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton replied. &ldquo;I
knew about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boat is waiting for you outside the
building at Air Lock Forty-seven,&rdquo; the clerk
went on. &ldquo;One of our men will show you how it
operates and take you home. Your baggage and
certain equipment for your home will be sent out
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kentons walked down a long corridor to
the air lock. On their way they had time to see
just how many kinds of service were carried on
in this most important center on Mars. If anything
should happen to the functions of this
building, none of the homes could survive for
very long.</p>
<p>Outside the air lock, the Kentons found their
boat awaiting them beyond a narrow strip of
ground. The space-suited man inside the boat
introduced himself as Martin Cooper. The
Kentons climbed in and took their seats in the
bottom of the boat, which was long and deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Ted was anxious to see how the boat was operated.
He saw Mr. Cooper take a marble-sized tablet
out of a box and drop it into a small tube at
the rear of the boat. Then the man turned some
switches. In a moment a steady popping was
heard underwater, and the boat glided off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all there is to it?&rdquo; Ted asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Mr. Cooper answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does it work?&rdquo; Ted wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pill dissolves in the tank of water, generating
a lot of pressure,&rdquo; Mr. Cooper replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the jet pressure that moves us along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a steering wheel to guide the boat
and a &ldquo;gas pedal&rdquo; to control the release of pressure
and their speed. Mr. Cooper turned the boat
into Main Canal, which was filled with other
craft like their own coming and going. Presently
the pilot turned out of Main Canal into a narrow
waterway scarcely wider than the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is like the &lsquo;Old Mill&rsquo; run at the carnival!&rdquo;
Jill said, as the craft wound in and out along
the irregular course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boat is great fun!&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;May Jill
and I run it some time, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have to when I&rsquo;ve gone off on
my expedition,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this water freeze?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It contains a kind of antifreeze mineral supplied
by nature herself,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;It never
freezes, no matter how cold it gets. It&rsquo;s another
one of the marvels of this planet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i13">
<img src="images/i13.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="270" />
</div>
<p>As they rode along, Ted was intrigued by the
strange glow of the Martian sky. The thin, purplish
atmosphere permitted the more brilliant
stars to burn through even in the bright daylight.
But then, Ted decided, it wasn&rsquo;t such bright daylight
after all, because the faraway sun looked
incredibly tiny to him, and there was a sort of
twilight glow to the whole scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Mr. Cooper guided the boat the last few feet
of its journey into a little dock beside the sprawling
bungalow which was to be their new home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;End of the line!&rdquo; Mr. Cooper sang out gaily.
&ldquo;Everyone out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Kenton was helped out by her husband,
she exclaimed in a shocked tone, &ldquo;Goodness!
The house is made of glass! We won&rsquo;t have
any privacy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not glass&mdash;it&rsquo;s strong plastic like that in
the main buildings,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for privacy, Mrs. Kenton, you&rsquo;ll have
that,&rdquo; Mr. Cooper said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a diffusing light
inside the walls that makes them solid-looking
when you turn on certain lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said with
relief.</p>
<p>As Mr. Cooper led them over a few feet of
ground from the waterway to the house, Ted,
who had been noticing the queer fixtures atop
the building, asked, &ldquo;What are those things up
there, Mr. Cooper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;The network of rods and wires are the television
antenna,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;That shiny disk
on a pole that looks like an oversized dinner plate
is your solar mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill wanted to know what the solar mirror was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It collects the energy from the sun,&rdquo; Mr.
Cooper answered patiently. &ldquo;That energy in turn
is what runs the generator in your home and gives
you electric power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While these explanations were going on,
Randy stood fidgeting. All this was old stuff to
him, and the explanations seemed to bore him.</p>
<p>Mr. Cooper led the party over the few feet of
ground that separated the watercourse from the
house. They entered a small alcove at the front
of the house; this was an air lock. Mr. Cooper
closed the outer door and threw a switch on the
wall. Ted heard air hissing into the cramped
quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>When this was done, the inner door was
opened and the Kentons looked around the front
room of their new home. The house was already
oxygen-pressurized for immediate occupancy.
All the furniture was of beautiful colored plastic,
and waterproof, much like the styles that were
popular back on Earth. The floor likewise was of
poured plastic, so that the whole interior could
be cleaned with a hose.</p>
<p>Mr. Cooper prepared to take his leave. &ldquo;The
things you brought from Earth and your months&rsquo;
food supply will be sent out in a little while.
New oxygen drums are brought around once a
week. If you ever need to call the headquarters
building, just use the radiophone over there on
the wall. Every home has its own broadcast
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kentons said good-by to their guide and
turned with interest to the wonders of their
home. Mr. Cooper had offered to show them over
the entire house, but Dr. Kenton said he had seen
the plans and knew what the rest of the house was
like.</p>
<p>There were three bedrooms in the one-floor
building. Since Randy had come to live with
them, Jill gave up her bedroom to the boys and
agreed to take the smaller guest room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>When all had gotten acquainted with their
bedrooms, Dr. Kenton took them into the basement,
which was just as large as the main floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down here are all the things that have to do
with the running of our home,&rdquo; the scientist
said. &ldquo;Over there is the water tank that draws
from the canal outside. The tank has a purifier
in it so that the water is good to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next room Ted found a mass of whirring
dynamos and turbines. His father told them
that this provided their electricity by drawing on
the energy from the solar mirror. They passed
down a narrow corridor. Inside one of the walls
was a niche containing a large gray tank with
dials on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most precious article in the house,&rdquo; her
father answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our oxygen drum. The air
from it enters a blower that carries it evenly
through the building.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The last room was the most surprising of all.
Dr. Kenton opened a heavy door, and Ted, standing
in front of it, gasped as a blast of frigid air
hit him. He saw his father grinning. &ldquo;That gives
you an idea of how cold the ground is,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;This is a natural deepfreeze. It never
varies more than a few degrees all year &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His shivering companions took a moment to
look inside. Ted saw a room as large as the upstairs
living room. It was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they bring our food, this place will be
a third full,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say I have to come downstairs
and go into that cold place every time I want a
stick of butter?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked unhappily.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton merely grinned at her. He led
them back upstairs and into the kitchen. He
opened one of several doors built right into the
wall. Frigid air seeped out of the compartment
just as it had downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our regular refrigerator,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;It connects by pipe to the basement
freezer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know that,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton returned,
with a smile of relief. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d have
to trot myself to death going up and down those
basement steps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Ted thought what fun it was going to be living
in their very own home on this distant planet.
Wouldn&rsquo;t he have exciting things to tell the kids
back on Earth when he returned?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c9">CHAPTER NINE
<br /><i>A Cry in the Night</i></h2>
<p>Hours later, Ted lay awake in the upper
bunk of the double-deck bed he shared
with Randy. The foam-rubber mattress under
him was soft as a cloud, and the cool artificial air
of the house inflated his lungs satisfyingly.</p>
<p>But though he was comfortable, Ted could
not sleep. He had lain awake for an hour. He
guessed it was because of the excitement of the
past few days and the fact that this was his first
night on solid ground after months of life in
space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>He climbed down the ladder to the floor,
quietly so as not to disturb Randy. He stared
through the clear plastic walls of his room at the
hushed Martian night. The sky was a glittering
canopy of starlight. Phobos, the fleet closer moon,
cast a weak light over the landscape. Beyond
their desert back yard, Ted saw the dark spreading
mass of the sand bog which he had been
warned about. It was like quicksand and would
draw anything that touched it down to destruction.
Ringing the bog Ted saw thick clusters of
white flowers, which his father had said was a
favorite food of the little Martian color bears.</p>
<p>Ted had also learned that the animals fed at
night. He wondered if any of the creatures were
in these parts, and if there were any chance he
would see one of them. He kept his eyes on the
bog for what seemed an hour, but he caught no
sign of movement down there. At last his eyes
grew blurry and he thought he could sleep. He
turned away and climbed the ladder.</p>
<p>Just as his lids closed, something startled him,
and he jerked up in bed. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what had
aroused him. He sat there in the semidarkness,
his heart bumping rapidly, his ears alerted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Then he heard a sound. It seemed far off. It
was like a wail, a cry. He came down the ladder
again. In his haste, he tripped on the bottom
rung and went sprawling. He turned anxiously
toward the bed and saw Randy sit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Randy,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;I thought I
heard something outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i14">
<img src="images/i14.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="344" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it, too,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>The two looked outside, straining their eyes
to pierce the shadowy night. Suddenly Randy
Whispered tensely, &ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Ted stared where he pointed. There was a
figure at the edge of the bog. They heard the
sound repeated. It seemed to be coming from the
moving figure. Ted suddenly remembered his
father&rsquo;s field glasses lying on a table in his
parents&rsquo; room. Before going to bed, all of them
had used them to study the stars.</p>
<p>Ted tiptoed down the hall into his parents&rsquo;
room. Carefully he lifted the glasses from the
table and returned to his own room. He could
hardly wait to train the glasses on the mysterious
thing beside the bog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it again?&rdquo; Ted asked as he
swept his glasses over the landscape.</p>
<p>Randy nodded. &ldquo;It sounded like a color bear.
He must be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally Ted found what he was looking for.
He was able to make out a little furry body
struggling at the bog&rsquo;s edge. The animal appeared
to be trapped in the marsh. One stubby
paw was grasping a root growing out of the
bank. Ted handed the glasses to Randy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a color bear,&rdquo; Randy whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
stuck in the bog. He&rsquo;ll never get out by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Ted saw a wistful look on Randy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I sure
hate to see anything happen to those little fellows.
They&rsquo;re so friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they make good pets?&rdquo; Ted
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure do,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;I owned
one once, until he fell into a bog. It seems they
always end up in one sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we could help him,&rdquo; Ted suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be dangerous,&rdquo; Randy warned. &ldquo;If we
should slip....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been around them before, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to try it if you are,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to wake the
others,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>Softly they crept down the hall to the space-suit
closet. Silently they dressed and inflated
their suits with oxygen. Then they went through
the air lock and on outdoors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Ted had brought a flashlight. The cone of
whiteness fanned out ahead of them, leading the
way for them over the red sands. As they drew
near the sand bog, the wails of the trapped animal
became louder and more frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hurry,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;He may
go down any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They broke into a run and finally reached the
side of the little fellow. The only part of him
visible now was his round head, from which projected
big cup-handle ears. His short forepaws
still clung to the root, but even now the boys
could see his grip loosening.</p>
<p>As they knelt beside him, they saw his violet
button eyes turned pleadingly up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank seems firm,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
brace ourselves and each take one of his paws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black mud pulled strongly against them.
After a few moments the boys&rsquo; arms ached from
the tug of war, but they appeared to be winning
the battle. Slowly the bear rose out of his trap.
Just as Ted thought his own arms would be
pulled off from the strain, the animal sucked
free of the clutching slime and came tumbling
up over Ted and Randy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>As the boys climbed to their feet, the color
bear ran up first to one and then to the other, and
licked their helmets gratefully with his long red
tongue!</p>
<div class="img" id="i15">
<img src="images/i15.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="363" />
</div>
<p>The little creature stood about two and a half
feet tall and was so roly-poly, he must have been
nearly that wide. The mud caked his body, some
of it crawling like thick molasses down into a
black puddle around his flat feet. He walked
upright just as they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with him?&rdquo; Randy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go, I guess,&rdquo; Ted replied. &ldquo;I wish
we could keep him, but I&rsquo;m afraid Dad wouldn&rsquo;t
agree. For some reason, he doesn&rsquo;t like color
bears. Besides, there&rsquo;s no place to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back toward the house. Presently
Ted turned and saw what he had feared. The
bear was trudging along behind. They tried to
shoo him off. This only made him hesitate momentarily
and then start following again. Finally
they gave up, permitting him to trail along at a
distance.</p>
<p>When they reached the air lock, they opened
the door. As they waited for the pressure to come
up, the color bear stood outside looking in at
them. Ted thought he had the most plaintive
expression he had ever seen. It was almost
human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him stand out there like that all
night,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;He might wake up the whole
house with his cries. They do cry, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like babies,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot, though,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t
breathe our air mixture, can they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they can.&rdquo; Randy told him. &ldquo;They have
a valve in their bodies that takes care of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we can wash that goo off him and
leave him in the kitchen until morning,&rdquo; Ted
said. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll be quiet if he&rsquo;s clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They let the bear in, and in appreciation he
licked their helmets again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to stay in here, you&rsquo;ll have to be
quiet,&rdquo; Randy warned, just as though the animal
could understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Ted cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo;
The little animal was reeling around as though
he could hardly keep his feet, and his eyes were
glazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always do that the first few times they
enter our atmosphere,&rdquo; Randy answered.</p>
<p>The color bear adjusted himself quickly to the
change and then seemed all right again. Quietly
the boys led him down the hall toward the
shower. In the bathroom they shut the door, removed
their helmets and turned on the shower
in a gentle spray. The bear did not take to water
willingly, and the boys had to force him under.
When he began squealing and kicking, Ted put
his hand over his mouth. As the little animal felt
the warm water, however, his broad mouth
turned upward in a grin, and he sat down in the
middle of the plastic basin to enjoy his bath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>While the mud was washing down the
drain Ted began to see what a beautiful creature
the color bear really was. His soft fur was white
next to the body, then merged into reddish
brown at the tip. To make him even more colorful,
his paws, legs, and head had a bluish tinge.
&ldquo;What a patriotic creature he would be on
Earth,&rdquo; Ted thought. He had all the colors of
the American flag.</p>
<p>When the animal was clean, Ted got out a
blotting towel that dried the bear in a matter of
seconds. The little fellow looked happy after his
bath and grinned at them. When he tried to lick
their bare faces, they had to cover up. He seemed
hurt by their gesture and pouted for a moment,
with his lower lip quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I mean?&rdquo; Randy said, grinning.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could keep him,&rdquo; Ted said longingly.
&ldquo;He seems like lots of fun. I think I&rsquo;ll ask
Dad about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>As they were cleaning up the bathroom, Ted,
who was leaning over the shower basin, felt
Randy&rsquo;s hand press sharply on his shoulder. Ted
spun around. Standing in the doorway was his
father, a stern look on his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c10">CHAPTER TEN
<br /><i>School on Mars</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you two doing?&rdquo;
Dr. Kenton asked.</p>
<p>Ted told him the whole story of the rescue,
ending up with a request that they keep the
Martian animal for a pet.</p>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s father shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.
There&rsquo;s no place to keep him.&rdquo; His face grew
stern again. &ldquo;You two did a very foolish thing
going out alone near that bog. You might have
fallen in. I want you to promise that you won&rsquo;t
go near that place again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They promised. Ted knew it was no use arguing
about keeping the color bear. When his father
made up his mind, he rarely changed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>As the three walked along the hallway with
the bear, Dr. Kenton said, &ldquo;You kids woke me up
with all that splashing in the bathroom, but, fortunately,
Mom is still asleep. We must be quiet
so that we won&rsquo;t waken her and Jill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear was reluctant to be forced out of the
house through the air lock. Ted knew the animal
felt no worse than he did. He had become quite
attached to the little fellow in even this short
time.</p>
<p>When the bear was outside in the dark,
he looked mournfully through the transparent
doors at his former friends who had rejected him.
Then he began wailing softly. Ted looked hopefully
at his father, wishing that he would have a
change of heart. But Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s expression was
set, and Ted knew there was no chance of the
color bear coming back inside.</p>
<p>The three of them retired to bed, but Ted was
a long time getting to sleep. For almost an hour
the Martian creature kept up a soft wail. Ted
covered up his ears with his air-filled pillow, and
he was finally able to drop off to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The next morning Ted and Randy went to
the front door the first thing after they rose.
There was no sign of the color bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he finally gave up,&rdquo; said Ted unhappily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand his being alone like he
was,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;Usually the little bears travel
around in families of about ten. I guess this one
was an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ted felt even worse. &ldquo;Maybe a
wild animal got him,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If it
hasn&rsquo;t already, it probably will sooner or later.
By the way, what kind of wild animals do they
have here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them ever come close to the colony,&rdquo;
Randy answered. &ldquo;Hundreds of miles away,
there&rsquo;s the Great Martian Forest where all kinds
of them live. One of the fiercest kinds are the elephant
ants. Big herds of blue rovers run across
the desert closer by. There are different kinds of
birds here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of a dangerous plant in the Great
Forest,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it called?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;The whip tree,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;It throws
tentacles around anything that&rsquo;s near and draws
it into its center mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing the dangers to the lonely little bear,
Ted had not much appetite for breakfast.
Neither of the boys nor Dr. Kenton had mentioned
the adventure of the night before, but
Mrs. Kenton had heard some noises, although
they had thought she was asleep. She began asking
questions and finally got the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could have kept that little animal!&rdquo;
Jill sighed. &ldquo;He sounds wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t adopt every stray animal that comes
along,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the color bear
will get back to his family all right. He probably
just strayed temporarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton next said that he was going to report
to the science organization this morning. He
asked the children if they wanted to go along and
register in school. They&rsquo;d have to within the next
few days anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the schools like they are back home?&rdquo;
Jill asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;They sure are,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;Just as
modern as you&rsquo;ll find anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the children were eager to go.
Schools in the twenty-first century were a combination
of wholesome entertainment and instruction.
No dry textbooks or cramped wooden desks
with hard seats. Ted and Jill had heard about the
poor children of the mid-1900&rsquo;s who had to plod
through school with such handicaps as these, and
they felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>Ted noticed that Dad seemed reluctant to
leave Mom by herself, but she did not seem to
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said
merrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have plenty to do unpacking our
clothes and things that they dumped in the living
room yesterday. I won&rsquo;t even miss you <i>four</i>
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young folks and Dr. Kenton went
outside in their space suits, Ted saw that the sun
was just a little above the horizon. He had
learned that men rose early on Mars to take
advantage of the warmth and illumination of
daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Dr. Kenton looked into the purple sky
through which the stars gleamed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly
six-fifteen now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; Ted asked in surprise.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t look at your watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; his father answered. &ldquo;That
little disk in the sky gives it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Phobos,&rdquo; Ted supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; his father answered. &ldquo;It takes only
six hours for the moon to go from one horizon to
the other, so you can actually see its movement
in a few minutes&rsquo; time. By judging its distance
from the star around it, I can get the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sure must take a lot of knowledge of
the stars to know just where each one should be
at any one time!&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; the scientist replied, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll
learn it in school. I&rsquo;ll bet Randy knows how to do
it now. How about it, Randy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; Randy replied with a grin, &ldquo;but I
guess I&rsquo;m a little off after being away so long. I
thought the time was six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Dr. Kenton took another look, and Ted could
see his face redden inside his helmet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
one who&rsquo;s a little bit off, Randy!&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Jill cried, &ldquo;Ooo&mdash;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half dozen large birds were swooping down
on the boat. Dr. Kenton did not appear alarmed&mdash;only
amused. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt us,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re whee birds and very friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful birds folded their scarlet wings,
tipped in yellow, and perched on the sides of the
boat. Then they began giving out a peculiar,
&ldquo;Whee-whee,&rdquo; as though they were enjoying the
boat ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they sound funny!&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>The birds soared away as the boat turned into
Main Canal. A few minutes later, Dr. Kenton
drove up to the building they had registered in
the day before. But instead of docking at the
building, Dr. Kenton continued along the canal
beside the building in the direction of the other
large building next to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the science building today,&rdquo;
the scientist explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that as big as the administration
building?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/i16.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="796" />
<p class="caption"><i>The birds soared away.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Jill, that science and research is
our main business on Mars,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton told
her. &ldquo;Every imaginable research project is carried
on there. Your schoolroom is there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton docked the boat at the science
building, and the four got out and entered.
When they had removed their space suits, Dr.
Kenton took the children to the school superintendent&rsquo;s
office, where he left them. The superintendent
had them fill out cards, and then he
took them down a hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only a hundred and fifty students
enrolled, so we don&rsquo;t need many classrooms,&rdquo; he
said, and stopped before one of the rooms, knocking
on the door.</p>
<p>A dark-haired young man opened it, and the
superintendent introduced him to the children
as their teacher, Mr. Garland. He assigned the
newcomers seats, and since school had already
begun for the day, he went on with his lesson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The room darkened, and a regular three-dimensional
color movie flashed on the screen.
It was a picture about the wonders of the Earth.
Ted felt a lump rise in his throat as he watched.
What he was looking at was the Natural Bridge
in Virginia, not far from their old home. Ted
looked at Jill. A stray pencil of light from the
camera showed tears glistening in her eyes. Ted
was feeling a wave of homesickness himself. The
wonders of Mars were exciting, but there was no
substitute in all the universe for their own little
plot of ground on Earth where they had been
born.</p>
<p>Ted was glad when the movie was over and
another subject was taken up. With slides, Mr.
Garland demonstrated the geography of Mars.
Ted learned that the red planet was mostly a vast
stretch of desert through which ran the marvelous
network of canals. Mr. Garland likened the
climate of Mars to that atop a high mountain on
earth&mdash;the air thin and cold.</p>
<p>Ted was glad when the recreation period came
and he could exercise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It was his first such opportunity since leaving
Earth. In the boys&rsquo; gym the athletic instructor
was teaching the game of basketball. Some of the
students like Randy had been born on Mars and
knew nothing at all about the game. Ted said
that he had played a lot of it in school back on
Earth and volunteered to help the instructor,
who was glad of the assistance.</p>
<p>When school was out, the young Kentons and
Randy reported to the science-building office,
where Dr. Kenton was waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get your assignment?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be leaving you in a few
days. We&rsquo;re going on an expedition to Hellespontus,
where some mysterious fossils have been
discovered. They may be bones of the ancient
Martians. If so, they could solve the baffling riddle
of what happened to those remarkable canal
builders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After getting into space clothes, they went to
their boat and started homeward. As they approached
their isolated house at the end of the
winding watercourse, Ted rose in his seat and
pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the color bear
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, seated on the front doorstep, as
though waiting for them to return, was the little
Martian animal they had rescued the night
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c11">CHAPTER ELEVEN
<br /><i>Yank</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the cutest thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Jill,
as she saw the red-white-and-blue creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were rid of him,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
groaned.</p>
<p>He brought the boat to the end of the waterway
and tied it up. The children leaped out and
ran to the bear, who climbed to his chubby feet
to greet them. He licked the suits of Ted and
Randy but merely stared at Jill and Dr. Kenton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like we just can&rsquo;t get rid of him,&rdquo;
Ted said, renewing his hope for possession of
the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, can&rsquo;t we keep him?&rdquo; Jill pleaded,
stroking the color bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Randy patted the little round head, and the
bear made a sort of purring, contented sound as
the children fondled him.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton threw up his hands helplessly. &ldquo;I
guess I know when I&rsquo;m licked!&rdquo; he burst out.
&ldquo;If Mother agrees, we&rsquo;ll try and keep him. But
you kids will have to attend to him yourselves,
and mind you keep him out of the sand bog, or
you won&rsquo;t have him long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; Jill said. Now that she had made
friends with the bear, he seemed ready to accept
her and licked her suit as a sign of friendship.</p>
<p>Randy stayed outside with the bear while the
other children went inside to talk persuasively
with their mother. She objected at first, but
finally yielded to their persistence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make out a requisition for plastic
material for his outdoor house,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;Are you children willing to chip in part
of your allowance to pay for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll order it the same time as we do supplies
for the garden,&rdquo; the scientist said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a garden?&rdquo; Jill burst
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d try it,&rdquo; her father said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way we can get fresh vegetables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dr. Kenton went to the study to make
out the requisition slip, Ted asked his mother,
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Dad want to keep the bear? It seems
to me that he doesn&rsquo;t like those little guys, or is
afraid of them, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, he is a little shy of them,
I believe,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He accidentally hurt
a baby one badly in one of his explorations a few
years ago, when he crushed its forepaw under his
boot and it ran off crying. Your father&rsquo;s so tender-hearted
he&rsquo;s probably reminded of that painful
incident every time he sees one of the animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll change after the bear has been
around for a while,&rdquo; Jill put in.</p>
<p>The air-lock door opened, and Randy stuck
his head in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d forgotten all about you, Randy!&rdquo; Jill
exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to keep him?&rdquo; Randy asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure are!&rdquo; Jill piped. &ldquo;Bring him in and
let&rsquo;s introduce him to Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy let the color bear inside. When he began
staggering about, Mrs. Kenton exclaimed
with horror: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying, the poor little fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy assured her he wasn&rsquo;t really&mdash;that he
behaved like this because of the extra oxygen in
the air. Randy said that before long the bear
would be able to go in and out without any bad
effects at all.</p>
<p>Ted brought the animal over to his mother.
She gingerly patted his blue furry head. In response
he licked her dress. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo;
Mrs. Kenton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to give him a name,&rdquo; Jill said.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Fuzzy?&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Kenton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Teddy!&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<p>Ted wrinkled his nose. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d get him
mixed up with me. I think he ought to have a
patriotic name because of his colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Yank, then?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo; Jill agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;What do you
think, Randy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged and grinned. &ldquo;It sounds all right
to me, but I don&rsquo;t know what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted explained the word as being sort of a
nickname for America and Americans. Randy
had learned quite a bit about the United States
flag, but the word Yankee was a new one to him.
After he learned its meaning, he agreed that
Yank was a perfect name for the color bear.
When Dr. Kenton returned, Ted felt that the
final introduction to the newest member of their
family should be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yank, meet Dr. Kenton,&rdquo; Ted said formally.</p>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s father smiled and approached the little
animal. &ldquo;Hi, Yank,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His hand went out to pat the round head, but
to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Yank drew back with a
cry of fright. Dr. Kenton&rsquo;s face went red as if he
had been snubbed by a human being. Ted felt
sorry for his father. Did the bear unconsciously
know what the scientist had done to another
member of his kind?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, John,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said soothingly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come around to you before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband quickly changed the subject.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made out the requisitions. I&rsquo;ll send them
over to headquarters now on the video-sender.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i17">
<img src="images/i17.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="413" />
</div>
<p>The children watched interestedly as he went
to the video-sender, which was connected to the
radiophone. He fastened the slips face down on
a glass plate and held open a switch for several
seconds. About a minute later, a buzz came over
the radiophone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means it&rsquo;s been received,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;I asked to have it sent to us tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you just phone it in?&rdquo; Ted
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way there doesn&rsquo;t have to be anyone on
the other end,&rdquo; his father explained. &ldquo;The requisition
was handled by an automatic machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank was given temporary quarters in the
basement. Dr. Kenton said he could not live indefinitely
inside like this&mdash;that an outside shelter
was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The next afternoon after school, Dr. Kenton
brought the children home. Sitting outside the
house on the ground were two pieces of specially
formed plastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the things we ordered,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
said. &ldquo;The manufacturers shaped them on molds
they already have on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color bear&rsquo;s house was a rounded dome
resembling an Eskimo igloo. The garden shelter
was oval and about twenty-five feet long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to lift those things?&rdquo; Ted
asked. &ldquo;They must be awfully heavy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, they&rsquo;re quite light,&rdquo; Dr.
Kenton said. &ldquo;Each of you grab a handle on the
side of the garden top and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They discovered they could lift the large object
with ease. They carried it around the house,
and Dr. Kenton showed how it would fit close
to the wall. The entrance would be by way of
the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dome is double-walled!&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton answered. &ldquo;So
is our house&mdash;and all the buildings on Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For insulation against the cold,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;The outer wall gets almost as cold as the
temperature outside, but the vacuum between
it and the inner wall keeps the inside nice and
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls are so clear in the house, I never
noticed they were double,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get started on the garden?&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
asked. &ldquo;The sooner we get it in shape, the
sooner we can grow tomatoes and beans and
dwarf fruit trees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>They first went into the house, where Mrs.
Kenton showed them a large pile of supplies that
had been sent along with the shelter tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a foam-rubber mattress for Yank,&rdquo; the
scientist said, pulling out two bundles, &ldquo;and a
supply of food for him. Everything else is for the
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing the four of them did outside
was set up Yank&rsquo;s house, close to the front door,
and lay out his sleeping mat. When this was
done, the little animal walked cautiously inside
and sniffed all around. Then he curled up on the
soft cushion and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems satisfied with it,&rdquo; said Jill.</p>
<p>First work on the garden was to air-seal it to
the rear of the house. This was done with a
strange-looking gun that shot a thick gluey liquid
out along the seams between the plastic cover
and the house. The rest of the work had to be
done under the dome itself. The workers went
back indoors and hauled all the equipment under
the garden shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we bring the warm house atmosphere
into here, so that we can remove our space gear,&rdquo;
Dr. Kenton said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>When this was done, and with their space suits
off, the workers could move about more efficiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After supper we&rsquo;ll prepare the ground, and
tomorrow we can plant seeds,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said.</p>
<p>Ted thumped the hard, cold ground with his
shoe. &ldquo;How can we work this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hard as stone, and it must be awfully cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father pulled some long steel spikes out
of the mass of equipment. Then he took out a
sledge hammer. He hammered the spikes at intervals
in the ground along the sides of the dome.
Then he attached an electrical circuit to each of
them and the whole to a generator.</p>
<p>As the generator purred in operation, he said,
&ldquo;Infrared heat rays are being sent out by the
spikes into the ground, warming it. After supper
the ground will be thawed out so that we can
till it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>When they returned to the garden area after
their last meal of the day, they found that the
ground could be worked easily. Electric tools
made the job quick and efficient. Fertilizer and
soil conditioner were worked into the ground
after the surface had been loosened up for several
feet down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say we could plant seeds tomorrow?&rdquo;
Jill asked, when they were through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; her father replied. &ldquo;The
chemicals we have put in the ground are almost
miraculous in the speed with which they work in
the soil. They can literally do the job overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill and Ted went to bed tired and untroubled
that night. But not Randy. Before Ted dropped
off, he heard Randy tossing restlessly in the bunk
below. Ted caught some of the words muttered
by the boy: &ldquo;Father ... miss you ... ever
come back to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been kept so busy during those first
days in their new home that Ted had almost forgotten
that Randy wasn&rsquo;t his brother. Randy
seemed to have taken to the family very well, Ted
thought, but he realized no foster parents could
take the place of his real father. As Ted fell
asleep, he was thinking what an unhappy day it
was going to be for all of them when Randy
found out that his father was never going to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c12">CHAPTER TWELVE
<br /><i>Illness Strikes</i></h2>
<p>The young folks planted seeds the next
afternoon when they came home from
school. Then in the next few days, they could
scarcely wait to see the first seedlings break
through the soil. The little green crooks popped
up the morning that Dr. Kenton was to leave
on his expedition.</p>
<p>The scientist said that the plants would grow
rapidly and produce edible food within the next
ten days. He gave the children instructions for
tending the crops, and they memorized his directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>He had showed Jill, Ted, and Randy how to
attend to the mechanical functions of the home
and also how to run the boat. The three helped
him to load his gear into the boat, and then stood
by as Dr. Kenton bade farewell to his wife. There
were tears in Mrs. Kenton&rsquo;s eyes as she waved
good-by from inside the house.</p>
<p>Yank watched the strange goings-on from in
front of his own dwelling. He seemed to understand
that Dr. Kenton was leaving, but he still
had not made friends with him.</p>
<p>When they were all in the boat, Jill dropped
a fuel pill into the tank, and Ted took the steering
wheel. He skillfully guided the boat along
the winding watercourse to Main Canal and
along its length to the science building. They
all helped unload the gear on the dock, and Dr.
Kenton said that this was where they must part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You three will have to run things while I&rsquo;m
away,&rdquo; the scientist told them. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
have any trouble, but if anything does happen,
call headquarters for help. There&rsquo;s one thing I
want you to be sure to attend to. Bring the empty
spare air cartridges in the closet down here and
have them filled. You never know when you&rsquo;ll
need them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring them tomorrow on our way to
school,&rdquo; Ted promised.</p>
<p>Jill hugged her father hard and long. Like her
mother, she was tearful at his leaving. Ted, himself,
felt a tug of dread. He wondered if the trip
into the Martian wilds would be a successful one
or whether, as in the case of Randy&rsquo;s father, it
would end in disaster.</p>
<p>The children went on to school. Ted was glad
to be going because it would take his and Jill&rsquo;s
minds off the melancholy of their father&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>Ted found the opening lesson particularly
interesting. In it he learned facts about the extinct
native Martians. Mr. Garland showed slides
on some diggings that had unearthed bones of
these early people. The bones had been organized
to the best of Earth scientists&rsquo; ability, but
many were missing, and the reconstructed figures
were largely guesswork. Ted wondered if his father&rsquo;s
expedition would uncover more information
on these mysterious ancient people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>As the young Kentons and Randy started for
home in the boat that afternoon, Jill complained
of having a headache. Ted told her it was probably
due to eyestrain from looking at the slides,
and this seemed to satisfy her. But when Ted
docked the boat at the house, Jill said she felt
worse.</p>
<p>Yank came running out to greet them, but the
boys were so concerned over Jill that they paid
little attention to him. He stood off sulking and
watched Ted help his sister out of the boat and
through the air lock of their house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, Jill is sick!&rdquo; Ted called when they
were inside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton had been spraying the hose on
the plastic floor and furniture. She turned it off
and allowed the spring on the hose to pull it back
into the wall opening. The water swirled
through the drain in the center of the floor and
disappeared in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked
in alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Ted helped Jill off with her helmet. He was
shocked to see that her face was feverish and her
eyes strangely bright. She wandered away from
the others and slumped tiredly on the divan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie on that rubber cushion, dear!&rdquo; Mrs.
Kenton cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still wet. What on earth has
she got?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me like she&rsquo;s got bog fever,&rdquo; Randy
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could she catch fever?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a virus that comes from the sand bogs
and sometimes gets through the air valve of space
suits,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better call a doctor at headquarters right
away!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton declared.</p>
<p>She went to the radiophone and put through
the call. She was told that all the doctors were
out on calls and that it might be an hour before
one could come. However, when a nurse on
duty in the Medical Center learned about Jill&rsquo;s
symptoms, she gave instructions for caring for
the girl until the doctor could come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>As Mrs. Kenton switched off the phone, she
said, &ldquo;The nurse said that Jill should be put to
bed and kept warm. Come on, Honey,&rdquo; she
added, helping Jill to her feet and leading her
toward the guest room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the disease serious?&rdquo; Ted asked Randy
worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be,&rdquo; Randy answered soberly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
probably have to be quarantined,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long does bog fever last?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crisis comes pretty quickly after the first
attack,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;I remember, because
a friend of mine had it. If they pass the crisis,
they&rsquo;re usually well in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was reluctant to ask the next question,
but he felt he must know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your friend recover, Randy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy shook his head, and Ted felt a cold
chill of dread run down his spine. He didn&rsquo;t
know what he&rsquo;d do if something happened to
Jill. She <i>had</i> to get well.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes later, Mrs. Kenton
came back to the living room. Her face was
drawn and worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sleeping fitfully and her head is burning
up!&rdquo; she told the boys. &ldquo;Oh, why doesn&rsquo;t that
doctor come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>With nothing else to do, the boys stared
through the clear plastic of the side wall at the
deepening afternoon. The purple sky was growing
darker, and the stars were gleaming steadily
brighter. On the horizon, where the miniature
sun was setting, the sky was painted in gorgeous
shades of red. Ted thought he had never seen a
more beautiful sunset, but he could not appreciate
it at this time.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ted spotted a strange yellow mass
gliding close to the ground and apparently coming
in the direction of the settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Randy?&rdquo; Ted asked. &ldquo;Do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for trouble!&rdquo; Randy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Ted asked, alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dust storm blowing this way,&rdquo; Randy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the house is well anchored to the
ground,&rdquo; Ted muttered. He had already learned
in school that such storms were often fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be an awful blow,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;It
may keep the doctor from getting through to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/i18.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="731" />
<p class="caption"><i>The whole landscape was blotted out.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Once more Ted had that sinking feeling. He
wished desperately that there were something
he could do. But, against the powers of nature,
he knew he was absolutely helpless. All he and
Randy could do was wait and hope.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the dust storm struck with
howling fury. The boys watched the sand spatter
noisily against the house. The whole landscape
was blotted out in a blinding, yellowish-red haze.
Mrs. Kenton came running into the room, looking
terrified. She had not been prepared for this
latest trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will this terrible storm last?&rdquo; she
asked, when Randy explained what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes as long as an hour,&rdquo; Randy replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton&rsquo;s hands twisted in frenzy. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t wait that long. We must have that doctor.
Poor Jill is twisting and turning so much, I can&rsquo;t
even keep damp cloths on her forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we call headquarters again,&rdquo; Ted
suggested, &ldquo;and see if the doctor will be able to
come out in the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>As Mrs. Kenton went into the hall to radiophone
again, the boys heard the storm striking
with renewed power. Fine, cutting sand whipped
against the plastic walls with the sound of sleet,
accompanied by an eerie roar.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton came back quickly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
sound at all over the phone!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Ted instantly thought of the aerial on top of
the house. He went to the center room and
looked through the clear ceiling. His heart sank.
The aerial was swinging loose by the single center
pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm has blown the antenna loose!&rdquo;
Ted told his mother. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even phone
headquarters now, and they can&rsquo;t reach us
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton left the room, moaning. They
heard her go down the hall to Jill&rsquo;s room. The
only sound was the furious clatter of sand against
the house and the groaning of the terrible wind.
Ted&rsquo;s eyes strained to detect some kind of break
in that awful cloud of yellow dust that surrounded
the house, hoping that the storm was
nearing its end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Suddenly Ted heard a weak sound outside,
above the roar of the wind. &ldquo;Yank!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;We forgot all about Yank! We&rsquo;ve got to let him
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran to the front-door air lock. There they
found the color bear clawing at the outer door.
The dust covered him so thickly that he nearly
blended completely with the yellowish background.</p>
<p>Ted flipped a switch opening the outer door.
Yank scrambled quickly inside. Then, when the
air pressure in the little outer compartment was
equal to that in the house, Ted opened the inner
door. Yank tumbled in in a flurry of scattering
sand.</p>
<p>Ted thought the Martian animal was the most
forlorn sight he had ever seen. His fur was dirty
and matted, his eyes were bloodshot, and every
step he took brought a cascade of sand down
around his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like he needs another shower,&rdquo;
Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else we can do now,&rdquo; Ted
agreed. Besides, he figured the activity would
take his mind off their troubles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Mrs. Kenton was still with Jill. The boys
marched Yank down the hallway to the bathroom.
When Yank saw what was in store for him,
he eagerly jumped into the shower basin. Ted
turned on the water, and streams of dark-red
liquid poured down Yank into the drain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have half the sand of Mars on him,&rdquo;
Ted commented.</p>
<p>Suddenly his mother came up to the door and
looked in. &ldquo;Jill&rsquo;s getting worse!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ted,
you and Randy must go out after the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c13">CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<br /><i>News for Randy</i></h2>
<p>Ted was not keen to venture out into the
dust storm, but thoughts of his sister lying
desperately ill quickly drove all hesitation from
his mind. He and Randy climbed into their space
suits, and as they approached the front-door air
lock, Ted was relieved to find that he could begin
to see through the thinning dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be over in a few minutes now,&rdquo; Randy
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>But if Ted expected any easy time of it outdoors,
he was mistaken. The storm still had a lot
of fight left in it. The wind struck them relentlessly,
turning them around and blinding their
gaze with whirling dust. They could not even
thrust through it to the boat. Ted signaled to
Randy that they would have to stand close to the
house until the storm had subsided even more.</p>
<p>At last the wind died to gusts. The air was
clearer now, and the stars were once again visible
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can make it now,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>They ran over to the boat and climbed in. As
Ted dropped a pellet into the tank, Randy said,
&ldquo;Look at these scratches on the boat! That sand
must cut like a file!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They jetted off down the waterway, Ted pressing
the accelerator pedal down to shove the boat
along as fast as it could safely go. They whirled
into the Main Canal and sped toward the science
building where the doctors had their offices.
Along the way, the boys could see that theirs
wasn&rsquo;t the only aerial that had been blown down.
They could see space-suited figures on the individual
houses working on the webs of wires and
poles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Some whee birds appeared out of nowhere and
flew down to perch on the boat and serenade Ted
and Randy with their strange chants. However,
the boys were in no mood for them now, and
presently the friendly birds flapped off as though
they realized they were not wanted.</p>
<p>Before reaching the building, the boys saw a
boat speeding right at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Randy warned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming
straight at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boat pulled up just beside the craft
occupied by Ted and Randy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the Kenton family?&rdquo; the single occupant
asked over his radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; Ted answered quickly. &ldquo;Are you
the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;The storm has
held me up. How&rsquo;s your sister, Son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bad off, sir,&rdquo; Ted answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I had to come for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn your boat around and don&rsquo;t spare the
horses, as they used to say,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be right behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Ted made the fastest trip yet along the waterway
back home. True to his word, the doctor arrived
right at his heels. The doctor jumped out
of his boat at the house, grabbed up a large case,
and hurried toward the air lock. The boys went
ahead and opened the door for him.</p>
<p>When the doctor had met Mrs. Kenton inside,
he asked to see the sick girl alone. The boys and
Mrs. Kenton paced restlessly in the front room as
they waited for the doctor to come out of Jill&rsquo;s
room. Finally, when Ted thought he could not
stand the waiting any longer, the doctor came
out. He was briskly shaking down a thermometer,
and his face was bland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a sick girl for a few days,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but she&rsquo;ll be all right. I gave her a shot of some
special serum we developed to combat bog fever.
It was none too soon, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears of joy on Mrs. Kenton&rsquo;s face,
and Ted felt as though he could turn handsprings.
Randy, too, looked vastly relieved. Although
he was not a true member of the family,
it seemed as though Ted and Jill were brother
and sister to him, especially since he had no
brother or sister of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid all of you will have to be quarantined
for a week,&rdquo; the doctor went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we ever find to do with ourselves
staying in the house for a whole week?&rdquo; Ted
thought. Then he remembered the garden that
had to be tended, that antenna that had to be
repaired, and other mechanical duties that had
to do with the running of the house. If they kept
busy, the time would pass swiftly, he reasoned.
The boys went up on the roof to try to repair the
antenna, but there was such a tangle of wires they
did not know where to start. The doctor said he
would leave word at headquarters for a repairman
to come out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a day or so before he can get out
here, though,&rdquo; the doctor warned. &ldquo;It looks as
though half the aerials in the settlement were
blown down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was actually two days before a repairman
came. By that time, Jill had passed her worst
time, and she was able to sit up a little and see
the boys.</p>
<p>Ted and Randy were amazed at the rapid
growth of the plants in the garden. Already they
were eighteen inches high. Ted thought he could
almost see them growing before his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>As soon as the radiomen had repaired the antenna,
the boys sat down to watch the television
program in progress. It was a newscast that
showed in color the events going on all the way
back on Earth and within the settlement as well.
The huge five-by-four-foot screen was sharp and
clear.</p>
<p>Suddenly the regular telecast was interrupted.
A local announcer was switched in. He held a
paper in his hand, and by the expression on his
face, Ted knew he had something very important
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; the announcer said,
&ldquo;we have just received word that several members
of the long-lost expedition to Syrtis Major
have been spotted and contacted by a routine
surveying plane. That is all the information we
can give you now, but stand by and we&rsquo;ll keep
you posted on developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy had sprung to his feet, and Ted could
see his body was tense as a coil of wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pops!&rdquo; Randy burst out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s expedition!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed
at the same moment. Then before his hopes got
too high, he recalled that the announcer had said
that only some of the men had been found.</p>
<p>But Randy did not appear to be bothered by
this. His face glowed with happiness. He was convinced
his father was one of those who had been
located.</p>
<p>An hour later, another bulletin was given: &ldquo;It
has been established that only six of the original
thirty-five members of the ill-fated expedition
are alive. Identity of the men has not yet been
given us. Stand by for further news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy bit his lip in disappointment as the
message was cut off. He and Ted remained by
the set for another hour without moving, hoping
any moment that more news would be given out.
At last it came:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our remote TV facilities will carry you to the
spot where the lost men were found,&rdquo; the announcer
said. There was a gray screen for several
moments, and then the scene switched to the
interior of a rocket plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be just like our going along with them
to the place!&rdquo; Randy exclaimed happily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Ted kept his fingers crossed for Randy. It
would be a terrible shock to him if his father
were not one of the survivors. The unhappy moment
he had dreaded for so long might now be
at hand. Their screen showed the swift trip from
Lowell Harbor over red sands and lichen forests.
At last the plane came in for landing in a wild,
rocky region.</p>
<p>The man who met the TV men in the plane
was the pilot who had first sighted the missing
engineers. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; the pilot said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll show you who the survivors are and we&rsquo;ll hear
their story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted saw Randy get up and move close to the
screen. He saw Randy&rsquo;s toe beat a nervous tattoo
against the floor as he waited. Mrs. Kenton had
come into the room in the meantime, when she
found what was going on. Even Jill could hardly
be restrained from leaving her bed to come in
and take part in the great discovery that meant
so much to young Randy Matthews.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;The men survived by holing up in an underground
cave, and they signaled the scouting
plane,&rdquo; the pilot explained, as he led the TV
men over the rocky ground. &ldquo;It was a landslide
that broke up the expedition, destroying all
means of transportation and communication.
The six who lived through it gathered up all
the spare oxygen tanks and food supplies. They
had plenty along because the expedition was
to have lasted three months. They carried the
tanks underground where a hot spring kept them
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the entrance to the cave was reached,
the pilot called inside, and six space-suited figures
walked tiredly out. They were not recognizable
in their space dress, for even their
helmets were too dark to show their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; the TV announcer said to the
survivors, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure every television set, at the
colony and on faraway Earth too, is tuned to
this spot. Of course, the big question in all the
people&rsquo;s minds is which of the men who were
lost are among you alive. Will each of you pass
before our camera and give your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted felt his nerves tighten as the men, one by
one, faced the screen. Two, three, then four
bearded men passed and gave their names.
Randy&rsquo;s father was not one of them. Two more
to go. Just then the worst possible thing happened.
The screen suddenly went gray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/i19.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="728" />
<p class="caption"><i>The picture flashed on.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Ted heard Randy groan. The seconds ticked
by. Still no picture. Finally, after five minutes,
the announcer said that picture service would be
restored in a few more minutes. Ted could see
the perspiration gleaming on Randy&rsquo;s face, and
his fingers were clenching and unclenching continuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a frightful thing for him to be going
through!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton whispered to Ted. &ldquo;I
certainly hope and pray his father is one of those
remaining two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture flashed on. The announcer spent
a moment or two explaining the difficulty that
had thrown the picture off; then he called the
two remaining men. The fifth showed himself.
In the close-up his smiling, grimy face was visible
through his helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;that him?&rdquo; Ted asked tremulously.</p>
<p>Randy&rsquo;s head wagged slowly in the negative.
Finally the last man walked up, and Randy gave
a scream of joy and sprang over to the screen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Robert Matthews,&rdquo; spoke the
bearded man. He smiled and waved into the
screen. &ldquo;Are you listening, Randy boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted looked at Randy. His shoulders were
hunched over and were shaking with quiet sobs.
Ted could see tears of joy in his mother&rsquo;s eyes.
Then he realized there was a lump in his own
throat.</p>
<p>Randy&rsquo;s father was alive. To Ted, it was almost
as though it were his own father who had
been found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c14">CHAPTER FOURTEEN
<br /><i>Peril in the Night</i></h2>
<p>Randy would have liked nothing better than
to have been at Lowell Harbor to welcome
his father, but the quarantine made that impossible.
However, Randy left word for his father to
phone him on arrival.</p>
<p>Hours after the sensational telecast, the radiophone
finally buzzed. Randy ran to it, flipped a
switch, and listened on the two-way microphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pops!&rdquo; Randy exclaimed. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me! How
are you?&rdquo; On and on the excited conversation
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful, Mom?&rdquo; Ted said to his
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Your dad and
I really believed Randy would never see his father
alive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank had been allowed into the house. He
seemed to realize that this was a moment of good
times, for he capered about like an animated ball
of fur. He even tried to make noises into the mike
himself, but Randy playfully pushed him off.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty good himself now, Ted thought
that if Yank wanted action he&rsquo;d give it to him.
He cuffed the little animal gently along his head.
Yank tore after him, catching him near the air
lock. Down went the boy and color bear together.
Yank growled menacingly but did not impress
Ted with his mock ferocity. Yank got on top of
Ted, and Ted called for help.</p>
<p>Just then Randy&rsquo;s long conversation with his
father ended, and he came over to join the fun.
Then the three of them were scrambling and
yelling together. Ted halted his play for a moment
to look up and see Jill standing in the doorway,
her face beaming as though she would like
to join the fun. Mrs. Kenton looked around, and
her face darkened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get back in that bed, young
lady!&rdquo; her mother threatened.</p>
<p>Jill squealed and ran off to bed. Ted saw that
his mother was not really angry. She was smiling,
and Ted knew she was glad to find that Jill was
feeling so much better.</p>
<p>The rest of the day passed on the same high
note of joy. Where several days ago, everything
had been fear and gloom, now everything was
rosy. The next day, after Randy had talked with
his father again, he was impatient to get out and
meet him. Ted, too, was beginning to feel the
pinch of the quarantine.</p>
<p>The boys went out to take a look at the garden.
The stems were high and full of broad leaves. It
looked like a miniature jungle here. And in such
a short time! Ted checked the atmosphere gauge
that showed the percentage of oxygen to carbon
dioxide in the greenhouse. The gas from the carbon
dioxide tank had to be just so, or the plants
would suffocate from an overabundance of oxygen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>When the boys returned to the living room,
Mrs. Kenton said to them, &ldquo;I have a surprise for
you two. Turn your heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did so, and when she told them to look
around they saw a fully dressed Jill standing
there, her cheeks pink and healthy again. Ted
hugged his sister as though she had been away
a long time and was just getting back.</p>
<p>At last, the day that, it had seemed, would
never arrive finally did come. Randy was up especially
early that morning, saying that he wanted
to visit his father before he went to school.</p>
<p>The children were in the living room awaiting
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll let you off from school one
more day to be with your father, Randy,&rdquo; Mrs.
Kenton called from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they do, I don&rsquo;t want to lose any time
seeing him,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jill pointed a shaky finger toward
the front door. &ldquo;L-look, there&rsquo;s a man at the
door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted turned around, startled. &ldquo;I wonder who...&rdquo; he
began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>But Randy was not puzzled. He ran across the
room and flipped the switch that controlled the
air lock. A few minutes later a robust man in a
space suit entered and pulled off his helmet. He
had a rugged, kindly face which showed the
effects of the terrible strain he had been under so
long. But he was smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pops!&rdquo; Randy cried and threw his arms
around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, what a squeeze you have!&rdquo; Mr. Matthews
grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown, Randy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When their prolonged greeting was over,
Randy introduced his father to the Kentons.
Ted&rsquo;s hand was almost lost in the large, powerful
grip of Mr. Matthews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time for breakfast, Mr. Matthews,&rdquo;
Mrs. Kenton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had a home-cooked
meal,&rdquo; the man answered wistfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were eating, Dr. Matthews heard the
story of his son&rsquo;s adoption by the Kentons. Then
he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you folks enough for taking
care of my boy just as if he were one of your
own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/i20.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="744" />
<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Pops!&rdquo; Randy cried.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Randy <i>has</i> been one of us,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said
warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say about that?&rdquo; his father
asked. &ldquo;Do you want to leave these nice people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy looked uncertain. It was a situation he
had given little thought to before. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really
like leaving them,&rdquo; Randy said hesitantly. Then
he seemed to have an idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, Dad! Why
can&rsquo;t you come and live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s
carrying hospitality too far. No, we&rsquo;ll build us a
house of our own, as close by as we can. Until we
get an allotment of housing material, we&rsquo;ll get a
room in headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use both of you living there,&rdquo;
Mrs. Kenton said. &ldquo;Why not led Randy stay on
here until your house is ready to move into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Ted put in. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t Randy do
that?&rdquo; He had been saddened at the thought of
Randy leaving the household. It had seemed as
though Randy was going to be with them always,
for he had not believed that Randy&rsquo;s father was
ever coming back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Randy thought this was a fine idea. Ted could
see that he did not like parting with the Kentons
any more than they did with him. Mr. Matthews
was reluctant to take further advantage of the
Kenton hospitality, but at last was talked into the
proposition.</p>
<p>The children went along with Randy&rsquo;s father
back toward town, following along in the Kenton
boat. Mr. Matthews said he&rsquo;d arrange for Randy
to have the day off from school so that the two
of them could have a good visit.</p>
<p>The young Kentons were glad to be back in
the thick of things. They found school particularly
interesting that day, because a field trip was
announced by Mr. Garland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year this class is given an exploring
field trip over certain areas of the planet so that
you can get a firsthand knowledge of Mars&rsquo;s geography,&rdquo;
the instructor declared. &ldquo;The trip is by
plane and will last two days. You must have your
parents&rsquo; consent, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon, as Ted and Jill left school,
Ted said, &ldquo;What do you think of that trip, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like fun!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope we can
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, too, but don&rsquo;t forget Mom would
be by herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten about that,&rdquo; Jill said disappointedly.
&ldquo;Mother would tell us to go on, if we
asked her, I know, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t want to
leave her. There are so many things that could
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to forget it then,&rdquo; Ted said.
&ldquo;Maybe we can make it another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two kept a brooding silence, and Ted
wondered if Jill was as disappointed as he was.
When Randy found out that they had decided
not to go, he said he did not care to go either.</p>
<p>That night Ted had a dream. In it he was exploring
on the great barren desert with Jill and
Randy but they wore no helmets and it seemed
as though they could hardly get their breath.
They gasped and choked, and the dream grew
into a nightmare of terror. Suddenly, Ted woke.
He sat up in bed in a cold sweat, feeling a strange
lightheadedness. His breath was coming hard
into his lungs.</p>
<p>It had not only been a dream. Something had
happened to the atmosphere in the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c15">CHAPTER FIFTEEN
<br /><i>The Peril Continued</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Randy, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was jostling his bedmate. Randy
opened sleepy eyes. He seemed to be unaffected
by the reduced air pressure in the room. Ted
remembered that people vary in their reaction
to this.</p>
<p>But when Ted told him of the danger, Randy
bounced out of bed with no further prompting.
Ted switched on a light, and just as he was reading
the air-pressure gauge on the wall, he heard
a shrill whistle in the house. It was the air alarm
that had gone off automatically. Ted could see
that the gauge read dangerously low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>If he and Randy and the others did not get into
space suits in a hurry they would suffer serious
consequences, one of which could be an attack
of the &ldquo;bends.&rdquo; At worst, they would lose consciousness
and die of anoxia&mdash;oxygen starvation.</p>
<p>Even before Ted could leave the room to
rouse his mother and sister, both were standing
at the boys&rsquo; door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get on space suits right away!&rdquo;
Ted told them. &ldquo;It looks like all the air pressure
in the house is leaking out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went immediately to the closet and began
dragging out space dress in a mad flurry of
fear. They pulled on the suits and helmets with
haste and inflated the airtight outfits with fresh,
pressurized oxygen from the small tanks on their
backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think has happened to the air
drum in the basement?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked her
son over her helmet radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but Randy and I can go down
there and see,&rdquo; Ted answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>The boys went downstairs, made a light, and
walked over to the giant metal tank recessed in
one of the walls. Checking the gauges on the
tank, Ted turned to Randy with a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is the trouble?&rdquo; Randy asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="i21">
<img src="images/i21.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="315" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a leak somewhere in the
house,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went upstairs, and Ted told his
mother and sister that all of them should spread
out and search the entire house for a leak. There
were emergency sealers on hand to plug such a
leak when it was found. The sealers were only
temporary, but they would last until a full repair
could be made by a repairman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Each of them took a room and worked toward
the middle of the house in their search, all lights
having been turned on to give maximum illumination.
The job was no easy one. Even the slightest
crack anywhere would be sufficient to cause
the loss of pressure; it was just like a tire tube
with a tiny puncture. Ted was the first to finish
his assigned area. He had found nothing. Presently
Randy was through, then Mrs. Kenton,
then Jill. No one had found a leak anywhere, and
the entire house had been covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have missed it somewhere!&rdquo; Ted
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wasted a whole hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spare cartridges your father told us to
have filled!&rdquo; Randy suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We forgot to in all the excitement after he
left!&rdquo; Ted groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked, horrified.
&ldquo;In another hour or so, we&rsquo;ll have used up
the air in our suits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we refill our suit cartridges from the
air drum downstairs?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Ted shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not built that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must phone for help right away,&rdquo;
Mrs. Kenton said and rushed off to the radiophone.</p>
<p>In a few moments she was back. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll send
someone from town with spare cartridges right
away,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the man said we couldn&rsquo;t
get a repairman until morning to fix the leak.
We&rsquo;ll have to stay in our space suits if we don&rsquo;t
find the leak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s look for it again,&rdquo; Ted suggested.</p>
<p>Once more they spread out all over the house,
but this time they changed areas, so that if a
mistake had been made before there was less
chance of repeating it this time. They renewed
their search, and it was not until all were
through, again without having found the leak,
that they realized that another hour had passed
and the man with the spare cartridges had not
shown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gauge in my helmet shows I&rsquo;ve got only
ten minutes of air left!&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>The others checked their gauges. All showed
about ten minutes&rsquo; supply remaining. And there
was no guarantee that the spare cartridges would
arrive in that time.</p>
<p>Just as Mrs. Kenton was going to the radiophone
to call the air-supply center again, the
phone buzzed and she answered it. After listening
a moment, she turned to the children with a
white face. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s boat developed some
trouble on the way. He says he can&rsquo;t get here for
fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be too late!&rdquo; Jill cried.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton relayed this information and
then said, &ldquo;He wants to know if we have any
neighbors close by we can borrow from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;ll take us more than ten minutes to
get there and back!&rdquo; Ted answered, recalling the
goodly distance to their closest neighbor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton reported this and then, after
listening for several seconds, she finally hung up.
&ldquo;He says that he&rsquo;ll call back to headquarters and
get an emergency truck here as quickly as possible.
But he can&rsquo;t be certain that it will get here
in time either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Jill began sobbing. Ted could see his mother&rsquo;s
lips trembling, but she was trying to be brave.
Mrs. Kenton hugged Jill to her, trying to calm
her. Ted saw Randy fidgeting nervously. His
own stomach felt queasy, and waves of terror
went through him as he thought of the consequences
of running out of air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Ted,&rdquo; Randy said finally to his
friend, going from the hall into the living room.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to find that leak. If we can find it
and plug it, the house pressure will rise to
normal in a couple of minutes. I remember our
own place doing that once before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve gone over the whole place twice!&rdquo;
Ted argued. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either we&rsquo;ve passed the leak without seeing
it,&rdquo; Randy went on, &ldquo;or the leak is in a spot that
we didn&rsquo;t look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any place we didn&rsquo;t look!&rdquo;
Ted said. &ldquo;Of course, there are some places we
couldn&rsquo;t get to, like....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both thought of it at the same time.
Both boys&rsquo; eyes shifted to the drainage hole in
the center of the plastic floor. Here was one spot
they had not been able to check. There was a
grillwork molded into the plastic that was not
easily removable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it is the drain hole, though,&rdquo; Randy
said. &ldquo;How can we find out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i22">
<img src="images/i22.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="387" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; Ted answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll plug up
the whole thing with a sealer, then check the
room gauge to see if the pressure builds up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>A rubberoid sealing patch was taken out of its
case and applied over the hole. They flattened
it out tightly to assist the adhesive to cling fast
in place. Then all four of them went over to
the wall to watch the pressure gauge.</p>
<p>A minute passed, and the needle failed to
move even the tiniest bit. If this did not work,
they knew they would surely be lost, because
from where they stood, they could see outside
for quite a distance, and still no one was coming.</p>
<p>Over his radio, Ted heard the nervous intake
of breath from the others. He knew his hurried
breathing must sound the same to them. Actually,
fear was hastening their doom because
the more scared they were the more oxygen they
used up.</p>
<p>Ted stole a look at his helmet gauge. Only
three minutes of air remained! His eyes turned
to the wall gauge again. He wished he could put
out his hand and push it along toward normal.
How desperately he wished for it to move!</p>
<p>Ted thought he noticed a flicker of the needle.
He blinked his eyes. Yes, it had moved! The
others had seen it too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It moved!&rdquo; cried Jill, almost hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly did!&rdquo; her mother burst out. &ldquo;I
saw it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>The needle continued to climb toward normal.
Ted had nothing to say. He was so filled
with relief that he was speechless for the moment.</p>
<p>They were all so concerned over the snaillike
movement of that all-important needle that they
paid no attention to the last few dwindling
draughts of air in their suits. Ted was the first
to realize that his tank was empty. He began
feeling that same lightheadedness he had experienced
in his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our suits,&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Pull them off! The
room is just about normal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unclipped his own helmet, then pulled it
off and drank in precious gulps of fresh air. The
others followed suit. Soon the needle was vertical,
indicating that normal pressure and air supply
had been restored.</p>
<p>It was five minutes before a light came swiftly
across the desert, moving in their direction.
They heard the pop of an exhaust a moment
later as a big-wheeled truck pulled up to a roaring
stop outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Ted knew it must be the arrival of the emergency
cartridges. But they had been five minutes
late. A shudder shook him as he realized what a
close call this had been. Had they not found the
leak when they did, none of them in the house
would now be alive to greet the men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c16">CHAPTER SIXTEEN
<br /><i>Disappointment</i></h2>
<p>The next afternoon, when Ted, Jill, and
Randy arrived home from school, Mrs. Kenton
told them that the repairmen had taken care
of the leak in the drain. It seemed that the hole
had been partially stopped up so that the water
had collected and frozen in it, causing the pipe to
crack.</p>
<p>Jill had been impatient to talk ever since she
had gotten in the house. Now her chance had
come. &ldquo;Mother, you know what Mr. Garland
wants us to do?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton smiled. &ldquo;What does he want you
to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants us to bring Yank to school for a
demonstration lesson in Martian zoology,&rdquo; Ted
broke in.</p>
<p>Jill&rsquo;s face clouded over with disappointment.
&ldquo;I wanted to tell her,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was a
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill slapped at him playfully, but Ted ducked
in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little clowns stop performing and get
ready for supper,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
eating early because I have a surprise for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A surprise!&rdquo; Jill echoed. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother smiled secretly but did not answer.
Jill ran off to her room and the boys went
to theirs. When the children had dressed and
washed, they seated themselves at the dining-room
table. Mrs. Kenton brought in a large
platter of real roast beef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the surprise!&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll settle for it!&rdquo; Ted put in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Beef was a rarity on Martian tables. It was
brought in only occasionally on the rocket supply
ships. Most meat was of the dehydrated and
cube variety that took less space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this is not the surprise I was talking
about,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said, &ldquo;although it was to
me when the supply boat drove up this morning
with special rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean there is still another?&rdquo; Jill
asked.</p>
<p>Her mother nodded and went on. &ldquo;The beef
took only a few minutes to roast in the electronic
oven. I remember my grandmother making so
much of a pressure cooker. She probably would
never have believed there would be an oven of
the future that cooked in even less time than the
pressure cooker and without any heat whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the main course of the meal was over
and apple pie was brought in, the children were
sure this was the surprise Mrs. Kenton had
promised. She said the supply boat had brought
the fresh apples with the meat. But even the
treat of apple pie was not the special surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>When supper was over Mrs. Kenton conducted
the children into the living room and
had them gather around a recording machine
owned by their father. Mrs. Kenton set a spool
of wire rotating and told them to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, kids!&rdquo; came a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Jill exclaimed.</p>
<p>They listened to a message addressed especially
to them. When it was over, Mrs. Kenton
explained that their father had called by remote
broadcast from his distant work during the day.
Then he had had her make a special wire recording
for them so that they could hear it later.
Mrs. Kenton told them this was the surprise.
The children admitted that this was an even
greater one than the beef and the apple pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Father sounded sort of sad or disappointed,&rdquo;
Jill commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton replied.
&ldquo;Their work hasn&rsquo;t gone along as well as they
expected. They had a small landslide that
buried the best of their diggings, which will take
larger machinery than they&rsquo;ve got to unearth.
On top of that, the tracks they thought would
prove to be a clue to the disappearing Martians
aren&rsquo;t human at all but belong to a group of
animals they have already classified.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Ted murmured sympathetically, remembering
how enthusiastic his father had
been before he had left. Now the greatest mystery
on Mars&mdash;that of the disappearing Martians&mdash;was
just as baffling as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re ending the expedition ahead of time
and coming home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he said he&rsquo;d be seeing us
shortly,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that, anyway,&rdquo; Jill murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he be back?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within two or three days, he said,&rdquo; his
mother replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be before the class goes on
the ...&rdquo; Jill burst out, then covered her
mouth with her hand as she caught herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the class goes on what?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to tell her now,&rdquo; Jill said lamely
to the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;The class is going on a sight-seeing rocket-plane
tour of Mars next week,&rdquo; Ted explained.</p>
<p>His mother looked at Jill curiously. &ldquo;But why
such a secret about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be especially
interested,&rdquo; Jill said, &ldquo;since we weren&rsquo;t going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Jill said. &ldquo;Only....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A knowing look came into Mrs. Kenton&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;I see! You didn&rsquo;t tell me about it and show
your interest because you didn&rsquo;t want to leave
me here alone! That&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kenton threw an arm around each of her
children. &ldquo;That was a very unselfish thing for
you to do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But now that Father will
be back sooner than he expected, you&rsquo;ll be able
to go after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we really, Mother?&rdquo; Jill asked enthusiastically,
her eyes full of stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be dangerous?&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton asked
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been lots of these trips made
already,&rdquo; Randy volunteered. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t
been any trouble yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have my permission,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton
said, &ldquo;but your Father will have to agree too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tomorrow&rsquo;s the last day we can make
reservations!&rdquo; Jill protested. &ldquo;If we wait until he
comes, we can&rsquo;t make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and make your reservations then,&rdquo;
her mother said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe your father will
object if I don&rsquo;t. But if he does, you can cancel
your seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose our money if we do that,&rdquo; Ted
said, &ldquo;but I guess that can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo; Suddenly
Ted looked fearful. &ldquo;Dad did leave the check-book,
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he left it,&rdquo; his mother assured him with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pops is coming out here tonight for a visit,&rdquo;
Randy said. &ldquo;Now that you and Jill are going
on the trip, Ted, I think I&rsquo;ll ask Pops to let me
go along too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be great!&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;All three of us
will go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the children got Yank up at
an early hour so that he could go off to school
with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be on your good behavior today,&rdquo;
Jill warned the color bear as they climbed
into the boat. &ldquo;If you cut up like you do in the
house, Mr. Garland may flunk us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank looked at her solemnly as though he
understood. But then his broad mouth widened
in a grin as if he were telling the girl that he had
no intention of taking her remarks seriously! As
soon as the boat moved down the waterway, Yank
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Yank,&rdquo; Randy told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
rocking the boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank paid no attention to this reproof. He was
enjoying himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; Jill squealed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll turn us
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randy rose unsteadily to his feet and moved
toward the rear. He made a lurch at him, but
Yank leaned out of his reach and looked back,
grinning merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You naughty bear!&rdquo; Jill cried, half in fear
and half in anger.</p>
<p>Randy leaned forward again and pulled Yank
back on top of himself with a fierce jerk. As
Randy went down, the bear rolled off him and up
on the edge of the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/i23.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="711" />
<p class="caption"><i>Yank went over the side with a splash.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Randy lunged at him, but Yank&rsquo;s fur slipped
from the boy&rsquo;s fingers. Yank went over the side
with a splash into the frigid water. As soon as
Yank touched the water, Randy made a grab at
him and caught one of his forepaws. Yank
screeched in shock and fear at the sudden freezing
plunge.</p>
<p>Ted slowed the boat down and turned the
wheel over to Jill while he helped Randy pull the
Martian animal aboard again. Yank looked thoroughly
beaten as he flopped, dripping and cold,
into the bottom of the boat. His round little ears
were drooping sadly, and the corners of his
mouth were turned down. He looked more like
a polar bear now, because crystals of frost were
growing all over him.</p>
<p>In spite of themselves, the children had to
laugh at their little pet&rsquo;s predicament. As the
shiny spikes of frost popped out on his face, Yank
would brush at them furiously with his paws.
Even his eyebrows were growing icy. This further
increased the laughter of the children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;ll teach you to behave, Yank!&rdquo;
Ted chuckled, and offered to take the wheel
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me drive the rest of the way,&rdquo; Jill said.</p>
<p>Ted yielded to her, and he was pleased at the
skill with which she drove and docked at the
science building.</p>
<p>The children were a little ahead of time, and
this gave them a chance before class to tell Mr.
Garland about their wish to make the trip with
the others. Randy had gotten his father&rsquo;s permission
the night before.</p>
<p>Mr. Garland frowned as he looked over his list,
and Ted had a sinking feeling.</p>
<p>The teacher looked up. &ldquo;Two of you can go,
but not all three, I&rsquo;m afraid. Yesterday I thought
that quite a few more could go, but I found out
last night I had omitted several names from my
list. Which one of you wants to drop out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c17">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
<br /><i>Yank in School</i></h2>
<p>At this surprising remark from their teacher,
the young folks&rsquo; faces drooped with disappointment.
For several seconds none of the three
had anything to say. Mr. Garland idly fingered
the two checks they had handed him.</p>
<p>Finally Randy spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop out,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on a trip like this before with
my father, but Ted and Jill haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine decision, Randy,&rdquo; Mr. Garland
said. He handed one of the checks back and
added the Kenton children&rsquo;s names to his list.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>For the moment, all interest in the trip was
gone for Ted. He knew Randy must be keenly
disappointed. Although until late yesterday none
of them had expected to go, they had talked a
long time last night with Mr. Matthews over the
exciting things they would see. Randy had been
quite as interested as Ted and Jill about the coming
adventure.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ted said: &ldquo;Take Jill&rsquo;s and my name
off the list too, Mr. Garland. I don&rsquo;t think two
of us should go if the third one can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jill agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make sense, you two,&rdquo; Randy
protested.</p>
<p>Mr. Garland looked up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense
both of you missing the trip for the sake of one.
It&rsquo;s the educational opportunity of a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted then gave in, although he knew it was
not going to be nearly so much fun without
Randy along.</p>
<p>The discussion ended abruptly when Ted
heard a shriek from one of the incoming pupils.
He turned and was shocked to see Yank chasing
one of the girls toward the back of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yank, come back here!&rdquo; Jill called, when she
saw what was going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>But Yank was once more enjoying himself.
He was grunting happily as he pursued the girl
around the back of the room, and along the
side toward the front. The bear&rsquo;s three owners
caught the little fellow as he was coming around
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just patted him and he took out after me!&rdquo;
gasped the girl who had been chased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was just playing,&rdquo; Ted told her. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t hurt you if he tried. His teeth are only
made for chewing soft flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Garland restored order and announced
that zoology would be the first subject of the
day so that the active Yank could then be taken
outside. First Mr. Garland stood Yank on the
platform at the head of the class with Ted to help
keep him still.</p>
<p>The teacher pointed out the physical characteristics
of the Martian animal, touching Yank&rsquo;s
paws, head, jaws, and other parts with a pointer.
Yank followed the movement of the stick with
his eyes. Then the whole class started giggling.
The bear was looking at the stick cross-eyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Ted had to force down a grin. He could see
that Mr. Garland was having the same trouble.
When Yank got tired of following the stick with
his eyes, he seized it in his mouth and began
gnawing on it. This brought a burst of laughter
from the pupils.</p>
<p>Ted took the stick from Yank, and the bear
thought this was a signal for them to wrestle. At
home, this was the way Ted usually got him to
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off me, Yank,&rdquo; Ted muttered in a low,
angry voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at school, not home! I
thought we warned you to behave yourself here!
You&rsquo;re just trying to show off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank seemed to get the tone of Ted&rsquo;s outburst,
even if he could not understand the words. He
stopped his foolishness and actually kept as still
as a little gentleman for the next few minutes
as Mr. Garland continued to demonstrate.</p>
<p>But then he could hold off no longer. As the
instructor was leaning over close to him to point
out the peculiar upsweep of his blue-tipped eyebrows,
Yank&rsquo;s big red tongue came out of his
mouth and scraped along Mr. Garland&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The teacher blushed at the renewed laughter
as he wiped his face with his handkerchief. Ted
was worried lest Mr. Garland hold Yank&rsquo;s behavior
against him. But the teacher was a good
sport and said, with a grin, &ldquo;You win, Yank.
Better take him outside, Ted. This will have to
conclude our study of Martian color bears for
a while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted took Yank outside and tied him beneath
the classroom window so that he could watch him
every now and then. Ted knew what the animal
must be thinking: &ldquo;Please let me in! I&rsquo;ll behave
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ted returned, the class was quiet again.
Mr. Garland set up the projector for a color
movie on American history. But this was not
merely a history lesson. The children were told
to study the costumes and architecture. It was
actually several studies in one.</p>
<p>When the picture was over an hour later, Ted
was blinking his eyes to accommodate them to
the harsh daylight again when one of the children
cried out, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Every eye in the room did look. Following the
pointing finger, they turned their gaze to one of
the transparent side walls. There was Yank standing
with his button nose pressed flat against the
plastic, just like a small child looking out a glass
window. This brought another round of laughter
from the class. On this note, Mr. Garland
dismissed the class for lunch.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as Ted, Jill, and Randy were
about to leave for the day, Mr. Garland called
them back just as they reached the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oh,&rdquo; Ted murmured with dread. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
going to give it to us now for bringing that little
cutup to school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meekly the three of them stood in front of
the teacher&rsquo;s desk. He looked up at them and
smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that little bit of fun hurt
us this morning. But please don&rsquo;t bring Yank
back again! I&rsquo;m afraid one day of him is all I can
stand.&rdquo; He looked outside where they could see
Yank seated on the ground.</p>
<p>He smiled again, and the relieved children
grinned back. They had started toward the door,
when Ted, who was looking back, pulled Randy
and Jill to a stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said. He turned them around and
they heard part of a conversation Mr. Garland
was having with one of the other pupils that
might very well work to their benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I hear that boy say he couldn&rsquo;t make the
trip?&rdquo; Jill whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he did,&rdquo; Ted replied.</p>
<p>They waited expectantly, hoping that the
teacher would look up and call them back. Ted
felt a new surge of hope rise in him when Mr.
Garland finally motioned to them. The boy,
meanwhile, had left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had a cancellation,&rdquo; Mr. Garland
told them. &ldquo;Randy, you can make that trip after
all, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; Randy burst out, his face beaming.
He fumbled around in his pocket for the check
his father had given him. Then he pulled out
the rumpled slip of paper.</p>
<p>The instructor smoothed it out and wrote
Randy&rsquo;s name on the list. The children left the
room and walked happily down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a swell thing you did, Randy,&rdquo; Jill
said, &ldquo;giving up your place to one of us. I&rsquo;m so
glad that you really can go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad too,&rdquo; Randy admitted. &ldquo;After all
we talked about last night, I sure wanted to go
badly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yank hopped around excitedly as he saw his
friends coming up to release him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see this place again, Yank,&rdquo; Ted
said to him sternly, as he untied him. &ldquo;I guess
you&rsquo;re just not cut out to be a school pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this remark, Ted got a juicy lick on the
side of his helmet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c18">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
<br /><i>Trouble in the Air</i></h2>
<p>Dr. Kenton arrived home the following afternoon.
Ted could see that he was a very
different person from the one who had set out.
His father looked tired and beaten. Even the
special meal of fresh fruits and vegetables from
their garden failed to interest him very much.</p>
<p>As they were eating supper, his wife asked
him, &ldquo;Why was this expedition so important to
you, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I had counted too much on its
being a huge success,&rdquo; the scientist replied.
&ldquo;Then too, I thought it would solve that all-important
question of the disappearing ancient
Martians that&rsquo;s been puzzling us ever since the
first landing was made here ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be other expeditions,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton
said encouragingly. &ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll find the
answer, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. But Ted
could see that his father was very downcast because
of the expedition&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had known you were coming when
you did,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said to her husband. &ldquo;I
would have invited Mr. Matthews to eat with
us. You knew that Randy had found his father,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was glad to see his father smile as he
turned to Randy. &ldquo;Yes, we got the news,&rdquo; Dr.
Kenton said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad for you, Randy. You
see, it never pays to give up hope. I&rsquo;ll be pleased
to meet your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Yank came bounding in from the
living room. The bear had taken to the taste of
lettuce leaves, and Ted would occasionally slip
him a leaf from the table. Yank sidled up to Ted,
where he sat next to his father, eyeing the crisp
leaves on the boy&rsquo;s plate. Yank&rsquo;s other eye was
cast warily at Dr. Kenton, whom he still appeared
not to regard as a close friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;When are you and I going to be friends,
Yank?&rdquo; the scientist said as Ted handed the bear
a green leaf. He reached out to pet the little
Martian animal, but Yank drew back. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand your attitude, young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted thought this the proper moment to bring
up a very important matter. &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;Jill and Randy and I have signed up for a
sight-seeing plane tour of Mars with our school
class. Mom says it&rsquo;s all right for us to go if you
agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton thought a moment, and Ted felt
doubtful. Then his father said, &ldquo;I think it would
be a grand thing for you. You can get a lot better
picture of this planet from the air than you ever
can from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody, we can go!&rdquo; Jill cried out.</p>
<p>Ted felt like shouting himself, for now the
last barrier had been removed and they were
going for sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The next week found twenty-five eager students
stepping into a sleek jet craft from the roll-away
ladder at Lowell Harbor. Randy and Ted
found a double seat together, and Jill sat with a
girl friend. When all the passengers were in, Mr.
Garland said that they could remove their space
helmets.</p>
<p>When all were seated, they waved to their
parents and relatives who stood on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as excited as if I&rsquo;d never made a trip like
this!&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited too!&rdquo; Ted admitted. He didn&rsquo;t
add that he had scarcely slept the night before
because he was in such a dither of anticipation.</p>
<p>Mr. Garland told the children to fasten their
safety belts, as they were almost ready to take
off. In a few minutes they felt the ship moving
beneath them. Ted waved a final farewell to
his parents and Mr. Matthews, for he had a seat
beside the window. When they waved back, Ted
felt a little uneasy. It was the first time he had
ever been away from his folks. He wondered
fearfully if something would happen on the
flight so that he would never see them again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Swiftly the rocket plane picked up speed.
Then, with a whoosh of jets, it launched itself
into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; one of the boys shouted gaily.</p>
<p>Soon Lowell Harbor was only a small circle
in the red desert behind them, and the vast
stretches of wilderness began to come into view.
Mr. Garland pointed out the important natural
formations as they cruised along. By now almost
all of Mars had been accurately mapped. There
were miles and miles of wind-ribbed sand dunes
with rows of furrows like a farmer&rsquo;s carefully
seeded fields.</p>
<p>Ted had never before realized the wonder of
the canals until he saw them from this height.
They were straight as arrows, and some were
tremendous in size, even dwarfing the majesty of
the Grand Canyon of Arizona. It caused him to
wonder again about those very accomplished engineers
of the ancient past who had built them
and had since so mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Ted recognized much of the landscape from
their geography study. Some of the ocher-red
deserts and forests had been named far back in
the past before the twenty-first century. They
passed over the great oasis of Solis Lacus and the
dense woodland of Mare Sirenum. But always
there were canals, and more canals, draining the
great icecaps and supplying the entire planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the sky pretty?&rdquo; Jill said to Ted and
Randy who were sitting behind her. &ldquo;It seems
we&rsquo;re closer to the stars when we&rsquo;re off the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted had to agree with her. The heavens were a
deep gorgeous violet, with the starlight pulsing
softly through. They traced the slow movement
of Phobos, the timeteller, and they could also
pick out the distant tiny moon, Deimos, that
resembled a white arc light.</p>
<p>The hours passed all too quickly for the eager
sight-seers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re over the Great Martian Forest,&rdquo; Mr.
Garland told them late that afternoon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
end of the line. After we&rsquo;ve covered this, we&rsquo;ll
start back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Ted looked groundward, seeing what resembled
a colossal, sprawling beast spread out in
all directions. Ted shuddered at the sight. Many
explorers had been trapped in this terrible wilderness
and had never come out alive. Wild animals,
blind trails, and carnivorous whip plants
were thought to have destroyed them.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone called out as he pointed
down, &ldquo;Look, what&rsquo;s that moving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All stared where he pointed. In an open space
inside the forest, numerous creatures were rolling
along like a tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re blue rovers,&rdquo; Mr. Garland said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re something like the old American bison
that roamed the plains of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More strange animals were seen, and still the
plane was not out of the huge forest. If anything,
the jungle grew even more densely, and now
rocky cliffs and shallow gorges could be seen
among the thick vegetation. Mars had no extremely
deep or high natural formations such as
the Earth had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the forest turns brown in the winter,&rdquo;
Mr. Garland addressed his students, &ldquo;but
when the polar cap melts in the spring, everything
pops out green again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Ted knew that the seasons were twice as long
on Mars as they were on Earth, even though the
days and nights were just about the same. How
frightfully cold must be the winters, he thought.
But on the other hand, what a long, nice summer
to enjoy!</p>
<p>Finally the dense growth began thinning out
again as the outer fringe of the forest was reached.
Suddenly, without warning, the plane careened
sharply on its side. Some of the students were
flung out of their seats, and they screamed in
terror. Mr. Garland, who had been standing by
a window, was thrown backward onto the floor.
When the ship had righted itself, Mr. Garland
climbed slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</p>
<p>No one else appeared to be, but Ted saw Mr.
Garland grimace in pain. He seemed to have
injured his ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Garland, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> hurt!&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me!&rdquo; the instructor said. &ldquo;Put
your safety belts on&mdash;quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>His students did so, and then the plane started
bucking again. Poor Mr. Garland was flung
against the wall this time, but he recovered himself
and hobbled into the pilot&rsquo;s cabin to see what
was wrong. Ted heard his classmates babbling
in fright all around him. He and Randy tried to
quiet Jill&rsquo;s mounting terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Ted said to her. &ldquo;It may not be
anything serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Garland was back in a few minutes, and
Ted could see that his face was grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to bail out, kids,&rdquo; he told the class
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into that?&rdquo; cried one of the boys, pointing
to the forest below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no other choice, the pilot tells me,&rdquo;
Mr. Garland replied, his voice shaky. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a fire in the jets, and we can&rsquo;t crash-land without
wrecking the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrified, the students stared at him, as
though they still could not believe what he was
saying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;He says there&rsquo;s an open space ahead of us
where we can parachute down,&rdquo; Mr. Garland
went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sending a message for help now.
We&rsquo;ve got enough supplies and air to last us until
a search party comes from Lowell Harbor.
There&rsquo;s no cause for alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no more time for talk. Despite his
obviously painful injury, the teacher quickly distributed
chutes and showed the children how to
put them on. The chutes were specially designed
for use in Mars&rsquo;s rare atmosphere. Next, space
helmets were donned. Then Mr. Garland lined
the children up with their rip cords fastened to
an overhead cord for automatic opening of the
chutes when they jumped. Ted, his sister, and
Randy had stayed together, and they found themselves
the first three in line to jump.</p>
<p>Chutes with supplies had been shoved out
first by hand, and then Mr. Garland signaled to
Ted for the first jump. Things had moved so
swiftly that Ted hardly had time to become
scared. Randy and Jill seemed to feel the same
way. The ship was still jerking erratically and
plumes of smoke swirled about. The oval door
was open, and Ted saw yawning space beneath
him. At Mr. Garland&rsquo;s word, he took a deep
breath and sprang out. He felt the straps on his
back yank him sharply as the chute popped open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Down, down he went.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Down, down he went. Finally he glanced upward
and saw two other parachutes above him.
They would be Jill and Randy, he thought. He
looked groundward again to see where he was
heading. Just as Mr. Garland had said, a flat open
space lay beneath.</p>
<p>Once more he glanced upward. There were
still only two other chutes above. Where were
the others? Hadn&rsquo;t they jumped too? Then he
spied the ship at a considerable distance away.
It was careening downward as though heading
for a crash!</p>
<p>Ted felt a sick tug in his stomach. It looked as
though the three of them were the only ones who
were going to escape alive. The ship must have
gone out of control before the others could
jump!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c19">CHAPTER NINETEEN
<br /><i>Terror in the Night</i></h2>
<p>As soon as Ted reached the ground, he made
for the spot where he had seen the supply
chutes land. If these were lost, especially the one
with the spare air cartridges, Randy and Jill and
he could never survive until help came.</p>
<p>Ted ran down a dusty ravine. His eyes
searched clumps of bushes and spiky cactus, and
a momentary panic came over him. The chutes
were not in sight. Just then he was aware that
a strong wind was blowing. The chutes had
probably carried farther than he had thought.
He searched some more, and his heart quickened
with joy when he found the two parachutes
within yards of each other, half buried in the
sand beyond a big boulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>As soon as he had found these, he thought immediately
of Randy and Jill. He should have
seen them by now. He returned to the spot where
he had come down, but they were nowhere
around. A new terror crept into his breast. Could
the wind have carried them farther up into the
forest, possibly into the dangerous part where
the brush grew dense as jungle and deadly whip
plants thrived? The wind was stronger than ever
now, but he ducked into it and renewed his
search.</p>
<p>He made a thorough examination of the territory
all around, but after a half hour&rsquo;s time he
still had not located Jill and Randy. For the sixth
time he returned to his original spot where he
had left the parachutes of supplies. By now the
blood red of approaching sunset was filling the
sky, and grotesque shadows were creeping over
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Ted could not remember when he had felt any
more depressed and lonely than he did at this
moment. He could imagine all sorts of terrible
things happening to his sister and friend. By
now, the wind had died down. Thank goodness
the blow had not brought on one of those violent
dust storms, he thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard a noise overhead that
quickened hope in him. It had sounded like the
drone of a plane! He leaped to his feet from
where he had been slumped on the ground and
searched the darkening starry sky. Yes, there was
a plane! He could hardly believe it when he saw
that the number on the wedge-shaped wing was
the same as that of the ship from which he had
bailed out. That meant that the plane had not
crashed after all!</p>
<p>As the plane roared overhead, he ran back and
forth and waved his hands frantically to get the
attention of someone in it. To his dismay the
plane kept on going and presently was lost in
the approaching twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>He thought the world had ended for him now.
Jill and Randy were gone, and hopes of rescue
too. But then he heard a crashing of bushes near
by. His heart thudded against his ribs in fear.
He was remembering that wild animals inhabited
this district, and he was totally unarmed.</p>
<p>Then he heard his name called. A moment
later Randy and Jill came running up! He was
never so glad to see two people in his life as he
was then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; he asked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind carried us down into the forest a
little way,&rdquo; Jill answered. &ldquo;Oh, Ted, I was scared
to death! Those whip plants throw out arms like
an octopus at anything that comes near them!
I almost got caught by one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted showed them the chutes that held spare
air cartridges and food. Unfortunately, Mr. Garland
had thrown out only a few supply chutes,
not all of them.</p>
<p>They had never eaten with space helmets on,
but they had learned about the tiny air-lock
opening in the facepiece of the helmet that made
this possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will last us through the night,&rdquo; Ted
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;ll do after that. A
search party probably won&rsquo;t get here that quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Just then Jill heard the plane returning. Ted
hurriedly explained that this was the one they
had been on and that it had not crashed after all.
He said that all three of them should run back
and forth and wave like everything to try to attract
their attention this time.</p>
<p>Ted thought that the plane had missed them
again, but then he saw it bank and head back
toward them. The ship circled overhead for several
minutes, and the children saw a parachute
drop out. They followed the chute to the ground
with their eyes and ran over to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a note,&rdquo; Ted said, untying an envelope
from the chute. He opened it. &ldquo;It says:
&lsquo;Open the long case and you will find a walkie-talkie
radio in it. Turn it on, and we&rsquo;ll speak
with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did this. Then Ted spoke into the mike,
&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came Mr. Garland&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;We had
just about given up hope of sighting you. The
ship went out of control just after you three
jumped. But the fire in the engine burned out
soon after, and the pilot regained control. We
should be able to get back to Lowell Harbor all
right, even though we&rsquo;re crippled. Are you three
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, just scared,&rdquo; Ted answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send you down all the rest of our air
cartridges and more food and water,&rdquo; the teacher
went on. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll last you through tomorrow,
and by that time a search party should be back
in a helicopter. We can&rsquo;t possibly land, ourselves,
because of the terrain and our damaged engine.
I&rsquo;d come down myself to stay with you, but my
ankle is broken and I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t be
much help. However, if you want me to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Ted said bravely,
yet feeling an encroaching dread even as he said
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an electron rifle and flashlights in
with the other stuff,&rdquo; Mr. Garland said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think anything will bother you, though; otherwise
I wouldn&rsquo;t leave you alone. Most of the animals
stay back in the thickest part of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be going now?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no way else we can help you except
send rescuers as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Mr.
Garland declared. &ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t leave
that spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ended their conversation. Presently the
other supply chutes filled the air, and Randy and
the two young Kentons retrieved them. Then,
lonesomely, the three watched the plane disappear
into the sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Jill murmured, casting an
anxious glance around her at the forbidding
woodland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too, Sis,&rdquo; Ted confessed. He looked at
Randy, and his eyes were enough to tell that he
was frightened too.</p>
<p>They looked around for some place of protection
overnight. As the sun disappeared behind a
distant ridge, they found a shallow opening under
a clump of rocks that would shield them
on three sides at least. Then they ate from a
food packet, and after this they admitted that
they felt better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get through this night safely,&rdquo; Ted
said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll probably make it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>At last darkness set in. Phobos was making
one of his frequent trips across the heavens,
but his light was weaker than moonglow on
Earth. However, it seemed to Ted that it
wasn&rsquo;t quite so lonely now, with the sky burning
with its millions of cold lights. Yet it was
still frightening to know that the three of them
were off by themselves in probably the most
perilous region of Mars.</p>
<p>They decided it was best not to use their
flashlights unnecessarily, lest they attract wild
beasts. They kept the atomic rifle handy in
case it was needed in a hurry. Ted suggested
that two of them sleep while one stood watch.
Jill said she&rsquo;d like to take the first watch because
she was too nervous to sleep anyhow.</p>
<p>Ted was just about to doze off some minutes
later when Jill&rsquo;s scream blasted into his radio
and brought him springing to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jill said, pointing.</p>
<p>Randy too was wide awake now, and the three
of them stared, fear-stricken, across the dark
drifts at a giant creature which stood at a distance
looking at them. The light of Phobos
and the stars was bright enough to show his
awesome outline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Ted whispered to Randy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an elephant ant,&rdquo; Randy whispered
softly. &ldquo;See that trunklike sucker on its head?
Get the gun, Ted. These things are mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted caught up the atomic rifle and set it for
fire, thinking all the while how Mr. Garland
had missed his guess about their not being
troubled by animals. Slowly the enormous insect
approached the opening in the rocks. It
was indeed the height of an elephant. Ted could
hear the rustle of its hard-shelled body as it
walked nearer.</p>
<p>The Martian animal&rsquo;s slowness up until now
deceived Ted, for, without warning, the insect
broke into a rapid run. Bravely Ted tried to
take careful aim and protect the two unarmed
ones with him. But even as he fired the gun,
Jill bumped him in her mad dash to escape
the oncoming horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Ted saw a blinding glare that lit up the
scene for a moment as brightly as noonday. In
that shocking instant Ted got a vivid view of
the elephant ant, its brown spindly legs and
antenna shining glossily, its curling trunk out-thrust
at them menacingly. But as the blast of
the rifle died out and the ant continued to
charge, Ted knew he had missed his mark.</p>
<div class="img" id="i26">
<img src="images/i26.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="700" height="325" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>There was no time to fire again. Ted couldn&rsquo;t
carry much, but he dropped his useless weapon
and gathered up the spare air cartridges. Then
swiftly he darted after Jill and Randy, who
seemed to have found a way of escape. He saw
them disappearing through a narrow passage
beside the rock. He was glad to see that Randy
had managed to hang onto one of the flashlights
and was leading the way with it.</p>
<p>Ted didn&rsquo;t know how long they ran up and
down rocky inclines and gullies. But they seemed
to be leaving their enemy behind. They ducked
in and out of clutching vines and creepers.
More than once, Ted dropped one of the bulky
air tanks, but he retrieved them, for they were
the most precious things they possessed. Finally
he caught up with Randy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help me take these!&rdquo; he urged Randy.</p>
<p>The boy took some and they hurried on after
Jill, whose fear seemed to have given her unusual
speed. At last they reached the point where they
could punish themselves no longer. Jill had fallen
exhausted to the ground, and Ted felt as if he
were ready to drop too. If the ant reached them
now, it simply couldn&rsquo;t be helped. Ted had
sacrificed the rifle for the precious air cartridges,
but he was not sorry he had done so.</p>
<p>They sprawled breathlessly on the ground,
their chests heaving, their eyes staring fearfully
in the direction they had come. Any instant
they expected to see the horrible creature bearing
down on them again. But after several
minutes, during which time the animal had not
appeared, Ted felt they had eluded it. For the
first time since the terrifying adventure, he felt
that he could relax.</p>
<p>And yet he could not relax, really, even now.
For the balance of the night still lay before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c20">CHAPTER TWENTY
<br /><i>Lost Underground</i></h2>
<p>The three of them decided it was not safe
to go back to the open area tonight. After
waiting a while longer still in the dark to see that
their attacker was not coming, they searched
the gloom around for a place to spend the rest
of the night.</p>
<p>Randy found an opening in the dense underbrush
ahead of them. Jill and Ted followed
him and his flashlight beam along the trail.
Suddenly they saw him stop dead in his tracks.
Ted walked abreast of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Randy did not reply but instead shot his light
ahead into the darkness. Ted saw before them
a huge cave entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, do you suppose that&rsquo;s the den of some
wild animal?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Randy answered in a quivery
voice. &ldquo;It seems like a good place to stay if it
isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill had joined them by now. She too had
taken some of the load of the spare oxygen
cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going into that spooky place?&rdquo; Jill
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go up to it carefully and shine our
light in,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d better be ready to
run if something comes charging out! I wish I
had that gun now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill hung back as Randy and Ted moved
stealthily forward toward the black cavern entrance.
Randy had his light shining directly into
it all the time they were moving. When they
were at the threshold of the cave, they got a
good view of the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not deep at all!&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;It just goes
back a little way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks deserted too,&rdquo; Randy added. &ldquo;Seems
safe to me. What do you think, Ted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go inside and see if there&rsquo;s anything
lying around,&rdquo; Ted suggested. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a den,
there ought to be bones and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously they entered the cavern. Its ceiling
reached high over their heads and the opening
was festooned with trailing vines and creepers.
Even the jungle growth seemed to have taken
over, weeds and thick grass choking the floor.
Boulders of all sizes were scattered around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it hasn&rsquo;t been used for years and
years,&rdquo; Ted commented.</p>
<p>They flashed the light over the whole interior,
but there was no sign of recent use. There was
one other exit&mdash;a narrow passage at the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we close up that rear opening with a big
stone, it ought to be safe for us to stay here,&rdquo;
Randy said.</p>
<p>Ted agreed with him. They called Jill, and
the three shoved a large red boulder in front of
the narrow passage. They divided watches again,
but before relaxing for the night, they replaced
their air cartridges with new ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Randy took first watch this time. Ted was very
tired from their exhausting race and had trouble
falling asleep, but the next thing he knew, Randy
was shaking him to change watch.</p>
<p>The rest of the night passed without further
disturbance. The boys got softhearted about
calling on Jill for her turn, and rather than wake
her, they stood her duty. Another change of air
cylinders had to be made before morning. Ted
was able to change Jill&rsquo;s while she slept.</p>
<p>The orange glow of dawn was a welcome sight
to the children. Things did not seem half so
grim in the dawn as they had the night before.
The sun&rsquo;s feeble rays shone directly into the
cave mouth. The boulder covering the rear
opening was still in place.</p>
<p>Ted caught Randy&rsquo;s eyes staring thoughtfully
at the boulder. He wondered if Randy was
thinking the same thing that he was: <i>What was
on the other side of that mysterious opening?</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better be getting back to the open
place?&rdquo; Jill asked, as they were putting on fresh
air tanks again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;The search party won&rsquo;t be coming until a few
hours yet,&rdquo; Randy said. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s not very
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted knew then that Randy, too, was curious
about the opening. He was stalling their return.</p>
<p>Ted then came right out with it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like
to know what&rsquo;s on the other side of that rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go and see?&rdquo; Randy said
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go just a little way,&rdquo; Ted added,
glancing at Jill, whose face showed doubt. &ldquo;Just
a few feet even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jill gave in grudgingly, but she got the boys
to promise that they wouldn&rsquo;t go far. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,
we&rsquo;ve got some food back there,&rdquo; she reminded
them, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m getting hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the air cartridges in the cave and
walked through the enticing opening, Ted in
the lead. He flicked on his flashlight, for it was
pitch dark. Ahead of him he saw a narrow
passageway. Slowly he moved along it, Randy
and Jill right behind him.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>They felt themselves tumbling downward.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>They were completely unprepared for the
shock that next came to them. Suddenly the
ground dropped away under their feet, and
they felt themselves tumbling downward!</p>
<p>All three of them cried out in terror as they
fell. Finally Ted felt his body striking a
cushioned surface. Then he was rolling down
an incline of the same soft material. Down,
down, head over heels he went&mdash;deeper and
deeper into the core of the red planet, it seemed.</p>
<p>At last his body stopped turning. Something
crashed into him from behind. Then he heard
heavy breathing and gasping and he knew that
it was either Randy or Jill who had collided with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jill? Randy?&rdquo; he asked in a shuddery voice,
still dazed by their rough experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Randy&rsquo;s voice came weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jill!&rdquo; Ted cried. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; she answered, from a few feet
away. &ldquo;What happened to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; her brother answered dully.
He felt around for broken bones, but he appeared
to be uninjured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you two all right?&rdquo; he asked Jill and
Randy.</p>
<p>They said they thought so. By now Ted could
see their forms very faintly. There was light
coming from somewhere. Their next task was
to try to find a way out of this dismal place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew we should have gone back!&rdquo; Jill
complained bitterly. &ldquo;Now we probably never
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sis,&rdquo; Ted said lamely. &ldquo;You were
right. I&rsquo;m sure glad we changed our air tanks
before we left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start looking for a way to the top,&rdquo;
Randy said. &ldquo;The search party will never find
us down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They discovered that the flashlight had been
smashed in the fall. They would have to depend
now on catlike vision to show them the way. As
nearly as Ted could make out, they were still
in a corridor. It stretched mysteriously ahead of
them, turning a bend about fifty feet away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be the only way we can go,&rdquo;
Ted said, looking forward. &ldquo;We certainly can&rsquo;t
climb back up the way we came down.&rdquo; He
looked behind at the steep, rugged incline they
had so unexpectedly tumbled down. The slope
was covered with a matting of lichens or moss
that had broken their fall.</p>
<p>They walked along the corridor. Finally the
light at the far end began to get brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like daylight ahead!&rdquo; Jill said hopefully.</p>
<p>They increased their pace in the hope of
finding a way leading back to the surface of
the ground. They made a final turn in the
winding underground aisle. Then the corridor
abruptly blossomed into a mammoth open area,
still underground.</p>
<p>The sight that faced them quickened their
heartbeats and made their mouths sag open
in amazement. Before them stood a towering
iron gate, through which they could see evidence
of one-time human habitation!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world have we found?&rdquo; Ted
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a city!&rdquo; Randy burst out. &ldquo;It is!
We&rsquo;ve found an underground Martian city!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c21">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
<br /><i>A Struggle Against Time</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A Martian city!&rdquo; Ted echoed. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
Dad like to be in on this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about an old city!&rdquo; Jill complained.
&ldquo;I just want to get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find a way to the top from in
there,&rdquo; Ted proposed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other place
we can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three walked up to the towering gates
and began tugging on them. At first the gates
would not budge, but after much struggling,
the children got one open wide enough on its
creaking hinges so that they could squeeze
through. Once inside, they began walking along
a rocky avenue lined with small buildings and
statues. The high dome of the city gleamed with
a light of its own, illuminating the entire grand
underground area like brilliant moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;The glow has probably been burning for
thousands of years,&rdquo; Randy remarked, &ldquo;ever
since the first Martians built the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably be thousands of years more
before it&rsquo;ll go out,&rdquo; Ted added. &ldquo;It seems to have
the natural light that Mr. Garland said some of
the Martian caves have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paused before a statue, and all three of
them felt chills race up their backs as they
realized they were the first Earth humans ever
to gaze on the true likeness of a Martian. The
man was not very different from Earthmen. He
had the usual number of arms and legs, but
he was short and spindly and his head was bald.
If the color of the statue was correct, the extinct
Martians had light-green skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad and the other scientists will sure have
the time of their lives with this place!&rdquo; Ted said.
&ldquo;It may even hold the answer to the biggest
riddle about what caused the Martians to disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t find out anything about it if we
don&rsquo;t get out of here!&rdquo; Jill said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a way to the top of the ground
somewhere,&rdquo; Randy answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
the Martians could have walked up that steep
incline we slid down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the dirt has covered it over during the
years,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;Maybe there are steps underneath.
But I don&rsquo;t see how we could expect to
uncover them. Let&rsquo;s go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="i28">
<img src="images/i28.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="700" height="255" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>They moved along, searching the uneven
rocky streets. It was not a large city, and the
three had no trouble keeping their bearings.
A check on their air supply showed only an hour
and a half of oxygen left in each of their suits.
There would be even less were they to hurry and
so breathe faster. This time they had no spare
cartridges. If they did not find their way topside
by that time, they were surely doomed.</p>
<p>After covering part of the city, the children
found that the end of it fanned out into five
separate narrow streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these streets may lead to ground
level,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing to do is try them,&rdquo; Randy
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save time if each of us takes a different
way,&rdquo; Ted suggested.</p>
<p>But Jill would have none of this plan. She
had no desire to follow a lonely underground
avenue by herself. They finally decided that
Ted and Jill would go together and Randy
agreed to go alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to watch out that we don&rsquo;t get
lost,&rdquo; Ted cautioned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go off down any
alleyways, Randy. We won&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to set a time when we both meet
back here,&rdquo; Randy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll count off ten
minutes and then start heading back whether
we&rsquo;ve found anything or not. If neither of us
has found anything, we&rsquo;ll try the other streets
the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Ted and Jill took their leave of Randy and set
off down the thorofare. They had to hurry because
of their dwindling time, and yet they dared
not go so fast that they were breathing heavily.
The way they followed carried them quite a
distance down the deserted street, on both sides
of which were crumbling buildings of plaster
set close together. By the time the ten minutes
was up, Ted and Jill had come to a dead end
against a stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way certainly can&rsquo;t help us,&rdquo; Ted
muttered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to Randy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they got back and Randy had not returned,
Ted became worried. Time was fleeting
steadily, and they still were no better off than
they had been before. Finally Ted heard a
scuffling along the street and saw Randy hurrying
his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I got sidetracked
on the way back. Then I had to run to get here in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that,&rdquo; Ted told
him. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got less air than we have.
What does your gauge show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-six minutes,&rdquo; Randy answered, after
checking.</p>
<p>Ted examined his own and asked Jill about
hers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an hour and five,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hurry if we&rsquo;re going to search
the other three streets,&rdquo; Randy pointed out.</p>
<p>This time Jill agreed to help by going alone
so as to save time. They agreed to cut the search
period to five minutes, at which time they would
come back to their meeting place. Ted had been
gone about a minute when he heard someone
calling. His heart stirred with hope, and he
hustled back at moderate speed to the place
from where they had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found a way out!&rdquo; Jill was crying
excitedly.</p>
<p>Fortunately they were able to catch Randy
before he got very far, and the two boys followed
Jill down the street where she had made her
discovery. After a hundred feet or so they came
into a big open area and at one side of it there
rose a huge stone staircase leading upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jill cried happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up!&rdquo; Ted urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>They started up the steps that slowly turned
in a half spiral as they ascended. After a long
climb, the children found themselves in a large
gallery. In spite of their hurry, the three became
as hypnotized by the sight of many stone
tables or altars arranged in orderly fashion
throughout the place. Lying on top of the altars
were long oblong cases, fancily decorated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These must be coffins!&rdquo; Randy burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; Jill pleaded.</p>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s gaze had turned from the altars to the
smooth, rounded walls of the room that were
covered with paintings from one end to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed, running over to the
wall. &ldquo;The Martians had a Michelangelo too!
Those pictures seem to tell a story! Say, do you
suppose this mural shows the history of the
Martian race and what happened to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they show, Ted!&rdquo; Jill retorted.
&ldquo;All I want to do is get out of here before
our air is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Ted saw the wisdom of her remark and gave
up an impulse to look over the exciting story in
pictures. Another flight of stairs was the only
way out of the shrine, and without delay the
three hurried up. They made a final turn on the
stairs and then the subdued glare of Martian
sunlight struck their faces. They were finally
above ground.</p>
<p>They appeared to have walked into a sporting
arena which was surrounded by tiers of stone
seats, much in the manner of the ancient Roman
Coliseum. As the three of them crossed it
through deep powdery dust, they found bones
of strange animals scattered over the whole area.
There were also the remains of curved swords
and scarred shields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Jill shuddered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling
what terrible things took place on this very spot
we&rsquo;re walking over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an opening over there on the other
side,&rdquo; Randy indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to it,&rdquo; Ted suggested. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait
to get off this gruesome field either!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>They moved across the arena briskly, yet not
too fast. They headed directly for the opening
in the high stone wall that encircled the ancient
field of contest. When they reached the entranceway,
they passed through and found themselves
at the fringe of a forest. A few dozen paces carried
them through green corkscrew trees to an open
plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the trees around here kept this place
from being discovered before now,&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way do we go now?&rdquo; Jill moaned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find that cave where our air tanks
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted made a quick orientation of their position
in relation to the arena and underground
city. &ldquo;My guess is the cave ought to be in that
direction,&rdquo; he said, pointing southward around
the bend of the arena. &ldquo;What do you think,
Randy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds right,&rdquo; Randy agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had no more than set out again when
Ted suddenly pulled up sharply in his tracks,
nearly toppling over backward in the motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Look what I almost stepped on!&rdquo; he
shouted, pointing in the dust ahead of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>It was a matlike object, lying flat in the red
dust, with rows and rows of fine hairs vibrating
over its surface. Ted remembered the deadly
carpet plant from his study of Martian botany
in school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted!&rdquo; Jill screamed, as she saw the danger.</p>
<p>To study the action of the plant for himself,
Ted picked up a broken shard of pottery and
tossed it onto the plant. Instantly the voracious
plant rolled up tightly, enveloping the shard
in its sucking folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what would have happened to your
foot if you&rsquo;d stepped on it, Ted,&rdquo; Randy said
in a shivery voice.</p>
<p>They carefully skirted the carpet plant and
hurried on, bearing southward in the direction
they hoped would bring them to the mouth of
the cave that had been the original cause of
their trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much air time, Randy?&rdquo; Ted asked,
beginning to pant a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen minutes,&rdquo; Randy answered, and
Ted could hear a nervous whimper from Jill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure this is right, Ted?&rdquo; Randy asked
worriedly, a few minutes later. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re wrong
we&rsquo;ll die. I&rsquo;ve only got seven minutes of air left
now. It&rsquo;s really going fast with us hurrying so!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Ted sighed heavily and felt a clutch of dread
in his heart as he studied Jill&rsquo;s pinched, anxious
expression. They <i>had</i> to be headed right! They
just couldn&rsquo;t lose the battle after being so close
to salvation.</p>
<p>At last they rounded a huge face of rock that
Ted thought he remembered. The cave should
be only a few feet away beyond that clump
of vegetation, he told himself. They pushed
through the curling, tubelike leaves. To their
left lay the cave entrance!</p>
<p>Randy gave a cry of relief and dashed into
the cave. Ted and his sister entered more
slowly; they had a little more time to waste
than Randy. When they entered, they found
Randy hastily discarding his old oxygen cartridge
and replacing it with a new one. When
he was through, he helped Jill with hers while
Ted attended to his own.</p>
<p>When they were done, they sat down on the
floor of the cave and drank in deep, refreshing
draughts of the precious gas they had feared
they would never breathe again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great?&rdquo; Ted remarked. &ldquo;Just like
a cold drink on a hot day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of food, I could use some,&rdquo; Jill
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved after all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and get it,&rdquo; Randy proposed.
&ldquo;We dropped the food case when the elephant
ant was chasing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the ant you&rsquo;re afraid of, they do most
of their hunting at night,&rdquo; Randy reassured
her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much chance of
meeting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started out over the trail they had followed
in such haste the night before. After
a while they found their food case where they
had dropped it. All made a run for it at the same
time. The sight of food settled their nerves, and
they ate nearly all of the supply in the case. When
they were through, Randy happened to look up
into the distance and jabbed Ted in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Ted and Jill leaped to their feet. They shaded
their eyes with their gloved hands in order to see
better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the search party!&rdquo; Ted burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s with them!&rdquo; Jill said joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see Pops too!&rdquo; came from Randy.</p>
<p>Ted uttered a deep, long sigh. Their frightening
adventure was over at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>

<br /><i>Of Days to Come</i></h2>
<p>The Kentons had just risen from the supper
table after a wonderful meal that had featured
fresh fruits and vegetables from their own
garden. Two days had passed since the adventure
in the Great Martian Forest. This was a night of
celebration, and Mr. Matthews was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us the surprise you had for us, Father,&rdquo;
Jill begged, as they all sat in the living
room together. Mrs. Kenton had left cleaning up
until later in order to be in on the exciting talk
of the evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I know for sure,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a phone call in a few minutes
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even tell us what it&rsquo;s <i>about</i>?&rdquo; Jill
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to build up false hopes for
nothing, Jill,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;You can wait a
little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a privilege to eat in such celebrated
company tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Matthews said, with a
wink at the children. &ldquo;You kids will even get
your name in the schoolbooks for finding that
fabulous city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pilot and Mr. Garland who got us
to bail out that should get the credit,&rdquo; Ted said,
with a grin. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for them, we&rsquo;d never
have found the underground city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mural showing the great events in the
lives of the ancient Martians was the most important
thing of all,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton remarked. &ldquo;I
was beginning to believe that the greatest riddle
of Mars was never going to be solved.&rdquo; Dr. Kenton
had gone to the underground city as soon as
he met the young explorers and had heard about
their outstanding discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Ted, Jill, and Randy knew the answer now, as
did every other colonist on the red planet. The
paintings on the wall of the shrine had revealed
the baffling riddle. It was simply and clearly portrayed
in pictures, just as though the Martians
had expected someone someday to know their
story. The revelation was that hundreds of years
ago all Martians had left their world in large
space ships because of Mars&rsquo;s disappearing oxygen.
Apparently there still existed somewhere
the remains of a supercivilization which had
built these space craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the animals on Mars will finally
die out, Dad?&rdquo; Ted asked, &ldquo;as the rest of the oxygen
combines with the rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, I would think,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose the Martians went to
find a new home?&rdquo; Mr. Matthews asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may still be looking,&rdquo; the scientist replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way to the stars, remember,
and we&rsquo;re sure they didn&rsquo;t land any place in our
solar system.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Just then, Yank came bounding into the room.
He too had been permitted inside for the celebration.
He had been eating his supper in the
kitchen. Ted was amazed to see the color bear
run up to his father and stand beside him while
the scientist scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Yank are friends!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure are,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said. &ldquo;After you
kids left, poor Yank was so lonely he even turned
to me. I guess he decided to bury the hatchet
when he found out I meant him no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he was so long making
friends,&rdquo; Jill remarked.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton took one of Yank&rsquo;s forepaws and
rubbed back the fur, revealing a scar. &ldquo;Yank is
the fellow I hurt accidentally a few years ago,&rdquo;
the scientist said. &ldquo;I just thought of checking his
paw the day you kids left on your trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never forgot, did he?&rdquo; Jill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I&rsquo;d convinced him I was sorry,&rdquo; her
father replied, rumpling the soft hair of the
bear&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;His injury was the reason he was
alone in the world. He couldn&rsquo;t keep up with
the pace of his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our family is so safe and cozy here,&rdquo; Mrs.
Kenton said, &ldquo;I hate to think of you going out
into that cold wilderness again on a new expedition,
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t be going,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton said,
with a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; his wife asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Just then the phone buzzed. Dr. Kenton went
into the hall to answer it. In a few moments he
was back again, and he was smiling happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids, how would you like to go back to Earth
at the end of the school term?&rdquo; he asked the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, do you mean that?&rdquo; Ted exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father!&rdquo; Jill cried out joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; their father said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what the call was about and the surprise I was
hoping to have for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the grandest surprise you could have
had,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton murmured, unspeakably
happy herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Science Union has offered this trip to
you, Jill, you, Randy, and you, Ted, as a reward
for your important discovery,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton went
on. &ldquo;They also want me to go back and give
lectures all over the country on our latest findings
about Mars. It may keep me there a long
time.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Mrs. Kenton said. &ldquo;I was
afraid you&rsquo;d have to stay behind here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted and Jill were so enthusiastic over the proposed
trip that they grabbed Yank&rsquo;s paws and
began dancing around with him. Randy stood
watching them, not quite sharing their high
spirits. When Ted saw him, he grabbed Randy&rsquo;s
hand and made him join in the celebration. A
moment later Randy was enjoying himself as
much as the rest.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenton said to Randy&rsquo;s father: &ldquo;They are
in need of some space-port engineers back on
Earth. If Randy would like to go with Ted and
Jill, would you consider a job like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not know it, John, but I&rsquo;ve had my
application in for such a job for years,&rdquo; Mr. Matthews
answered, highly pleased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll take
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you kids will stop jumping around a minute,&rdquo;
Dr. Kenton said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something else
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped and listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go Earthward it may be a long time before
we come back to Mars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&mdash;or at
least you&mdash;may never get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right with me,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen enough of Mars to last me a lifetime! It&rsquo;s
interesting here, but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to
good old Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo; Jill chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more here that I should like to look
into,&rdquo; the scientist said, with a brooding look on
his face. &ldquo;There are still many unsolved mysteries,
such as how these great canals were built, and
I&rsquo;d like to be in on the discovery&mdash;if and when
it&rsquo;s ever made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take Yank home with us to Virginia,
can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Jill asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Dr. Kenton answered.
&ldquo;He seemed to adapt himself to our breathing
mixture all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Jill hugged the little Martian animal and got
a grateful lick in return. Then the Kenton children
took Randy aside and began telling him of
the wonders of Earth that he would soon be able
to see for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until you enjoy the fun of a swim on
a hot day!&rdquo; Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And the cold air turning your nose red in
the winter and the crunch of snow under your
feet!&rdquo; Jill put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds great,&rdquo; Randy said, his eyes sparkling
with anticipation. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to
like Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; Ted said earnestly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing as wonderful as Earth in all
the universe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looked as though Ted&rsquo;s trip to Mars would
turn out to be nothing more than a long visit. A
few weeks from now he would be a traveler returning
home to his beloved land. What wondrous
stories he&rsquo;d tell the kids back there of adventure
on the mysterious red planet which hung
in the deeps of everlasting night!</p>

<p>Ted and Jill Kenton and their parents
are en route by space ship to Mars where
Dr. Kenton is to pursue scientific research.
As they are guided around the flying space
ship, a crisis develops. Another space ship
is bearing down on their own craft. The
ships just manage to scrape by each other,
but the Kenton ship is slightly damaged
and must make an emergency landing on
the moon for repairs.</p>
<p>Here they meet Randy Matthews,
whose father is missing on another Martian
expedition, and arrangements are
made for Randy to join the Kentons. The
ship is repaired and takes off to continue
the flight to Mars.</p>
<p>There new and exciting adventures befall
Jill, Ted, and Randy. They rescue a
color bear who becomes their pet; they discover
an air leak in their space suits and
barely escape with their lives; and eventually
after encountering hitherto unknown
dangers, they find the lost caves of the
early Martians and open the way to research
of the earlier civilization.</p>
<p>This book of continuous thrills and excitement
will hold the reader spellbound
while inspiring real thought of the scientific
possibilities of space travel.</p>

<p>It was in the days when the Pawnees and
the Sioux roamed the plains in search of
buffalo herds. In the camp of the Sioux,
Chief Great Bear sat at the council fire
with his braves who planned to drive the
Pawnees from the Sioux hunting grounds.</p>
<p>But Great Bear had other problems.
His grandson, Little Bear, was beginning
to grow up. He had to be taught how to
use a bow and arrow, how to shoot
straight, how to saddle a horse, how to
ride, and the many things a young Indian
needed to learn.</p>
<p>How Great Bear trained his little grandson
and how together they tracked a horse
thief who stole their horses; how the courage,
determination, and ability of Little
Bear saved the entire tribe, make absorbing,
exciting reading, and when at length
Little Bear is finally called &ldquo;warrior,&rdquo; the
reader has an authentic, historically accurate
picture of the real life of a boy in
an Indian tribe.</p>
